<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>



<p class="normal">This, the last volume of <span class="sc">THE GERMAN CLASSICS</span>,
was intended to be devoted to the contemporary drama exclusively. But the
harvest of the contemporary German Short Story is so rich that an overflow from
Volume XIX had to be accommodated in Volume XX. It is hoped that this has not
seriously crippled the representative character of the dramatic selections,
although the editors are fully aware of the importance of such dramatists as
Herbert Eulenberg, Wilhelm Schmidtbonn, or Fritz von Unruh. The principal
tendencies, at any rate, of the hopeful and eager activity which distinguishes
the German stage of today are brought out in this volume with sufficient
clearness, especially in combination with the selections from Schönherr and
Hofmannsthal in Volumes XVI and XVII.</p>

<p class="normal">The European war, unfortunately, has prevented us from making
the selections from contemporary German painting in Volumes XIX and XX as varied
and representative as we had hoped.</p>

<h2><a name="div2_mirabel" href="#div2Ref_mirabel">CLARISSA MIRABEL (1906)</a></h2>
<h3>TRANSLATED BY JULIA FRANKLIN</h3>

<p class="normal">In the little town of Rodez, situated on the western side of
the Cévennes and washed by the waters of the river Aveyron, there lived a lawyer
by the name of Fualdes, a commonplace man, neither good nor bad. Notwithstanding
his advanced age, he had only recently retired from affairs, and his finances
were in such a bad shape that he was obliged, in the beginning of the year 1817,
to dispose of his estate of La Morne. With the proceeds he meant to retire to
some quiet spot and live on the interest of his money. One evening&#8212;it was the
nineteenth of March&#8212;he received from the purchaser of the estate, President
Seguret, the residue of the purchase-money in bills and securities, and, after
locking the papers in his desk, he left the house, having told the housekeeper
that he had to go to La Morne once more in order to make some necessary
arrangements with the tenant.</p>

<p class="normal">He neither reached La Morne nor returned to his home. The
following morning a tailor's wife from the village of Aveyron saw his body lying
in a shallow of the river, ran to Rodez and fetched some people back with her.
The rocky slope was precipitously steep at that point, rising to a height of
about forty feet. A great piece of the narrow footpath which led from Rodez to
the vineyards had crumbled away, and it was doubtless owing to that circumstance
that the unfortunate man had been precipitated to the bottom. It had rained very
heavily the day before, and the soil on top had, according to the testimony of a
number of people who worked in the vineyards, been loose for a long time. It
seemed a singular fact that there was a deep gash in the throat of the dead man;
but as jagged stones projected all over the rocky surface of the slope, such an
injury explained itself. On examination of the steep wall, no traces of blood
were found on stone or earth. The rain had washed away everything.</p>

<p class="normal">The news of the occurrence spread rapidly, and all through the
day two or three hundred people from Rodez&#8212;men, women, and children&#8212;were
standing on both shores staring with a look of fascination and self-induced
horror into the depths of the ravine. The question was raised whether it was not
a will-o'-the-wisp that had misled the old man. A woman alleged that she had
spoken with a shepherd who declared he had heard a cry for help; this, it is
true, occurred about midnight, and Fualdes had left his house at eight o'clock.
A stout tinker contended that the darkness had not been as dense as all
believed; he himself had crossed the fields, on his way from La Valette, at nine
o'clock, and the moon was then shining. The inspector of customs took him
severely to task, and informed him that a new moon had made its appearance the
day before, as one could easily find out by looking in the calendar. The tinker
shrugged his shoulders, as if to say that in such conjunctures even the calendar
was not to be trusted.</p>

<p class="normal">When it grew dusk the people wandered homeward, in pairs and
groups, now chatting, now silent, now whispering with an air of mystery. Like
dogs that have become suspicious and keep circling about the same spot, they
strained with hungry eagerness for a new excitement. They looked searchingly in
front of them, heard with sharpened ears every word that was uttered. Some cast
suspicious side-glances at each other; those who had money closed their doors
and counted their money over. At night in the taverns the guests told of the
great riches that the miserly Fualdes had accumulated; he had, it was said, sold
La Morne only because he shrank from compelling the lessee, Grammont, who was
his nephew, by legal means to pay two years' arrears of rent.</p>

<p class="normal">The spoken word hung halting on the lips, carrying a
half-framed thought in its train. It was an accepted fact among the citizens
that Fualdes, the liberal Protestant, a former official of the Empire, had been
annoyed by threats against his life. The dark fancies spun busily at the web of
fear. Those who still believed it was an accident refrained from expressing
their reasons; they had to guard against suspicion falling upon themselves.
Already a band of confederates was designated, drawn from the Legitimist party,
now become inimical, threatening, arrogant. Dark hatred pointed to the Jesuits
and their missions as instigators of the mysterious deed. How often had justice
halted when the power of the mighty shielded the criminal!</p>

<p class="normal">The spring sun of the ensuing day shone upon tense, agitated,
eager faces gradually inflamed to fierceness. The Royalists began to fear for
their belongings; in order to protect themselves, infected as they, too, were by
the general horror which emanated from the unknown, they admitted that a crime
had been perpetrated. But how? and where? and through whom?</p>

<p class="normal">A cobbler has a better memory, as a rule, and a more active
brain, than other people. The shoemaker, Escarboeuf, used to gather his
neighbors and trusty comrades about him now and then at the hour of vespers. He
remembered exactly what the doctor had said on the discovery of the corpse; he
was standing close by and had heard every syllable. &quot;It almost looks as if the
man had been murdered;&quot; those were the astonished words of the doctor when he
was examining the wound in the throat. &quot;Murdered? what are you saying, man?&quot;
interposed one of the company. &quot;Yes, murdered!&quot; cried the cobbler
triumphantly.&#8212;&quot;But it is said that there was sand sticking to the wound,&quot;
remarked a young man shyly.&#8212;&quot;O pshaw! sand, sand!&quot; retorted the shoemaker, &quot;What
does sand prove anyway?&quot;&#8212;&quot;No, sand proves nothing,&quot; all of them admitted. And by
midday the report in all the houses of the quarter ran: Fualdes had been
murdered, he had been butchered. The word gave the inflamed minds a picture, the
whispering tongues a hint.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, by a strange chance it happened that on that fateful
evening the night watchman had deposited in the guardroom a cane with an ivory
knob and a gilt ring, which he had found in front of the Bancal dwelling,
separated from lawyer Fualdes' house by the Rue de l'Ambrague, a dark cross
street. Fualdes' housekeeper, an old deaf woman, asserted positively that the
cane was the property of her master; her assertion seemed incontestable. A long
time after, it came to light that the cane belonged to a traveling tradesman who
had spent the night carousing in the company of some wenches; but at the time,
attention was at once turned to the Bancal house, a dilapidated, gloomy building
with musty, dirty corners. It had formerly been owned by a butcher, and pigs
were still kept in the yard. It was a house of assignation and was visited
nightly by soldiers, smugglers, and questionable-looking girls; now and then,
too, heavily veiled ladies and aristocratic-looking men slipped in and out. On
the ground floor there lived, beside the Bancal couple, a former soldier,
Colard, and his sweetheart, the wench Bedos, and the humpbacked Missonier; above
them, there dwelt an old Spaniard, by the name of Saavedra, and his wife; he was
a political refugee who had sought protection in France.</p>

<p class="normal">On the afternoon of the twenty-first of March, the soldier,
Colard, was standing at the corner of the Rue de l'Ambrague, playing a
monotonous air on his flute, one that he had learned from the shepherds of the
Pyrenees. The shopkeeper, Galtier, came up the road, stood still, made a
pretense of listening, but finally interrupted the musician, addressing him
severely: &quot;Why do you gad about and pretend to be ignorant, Colard? Don't you
know, then, that the murder is said to have been committed in your house?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Colard, brushing his scrubby moustache from his lips, replied
that he and Missonier had been in Rose Feral's tavern, alongside the Bancal
house, that night. &quot;Had I heard a noise, sir,&quot; he said boastfully, &quot;I should
have gone to the rescue, for I have two guns.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who else was at Rose Feral's?&quot; pursued the shopkeeper. Colard
meditated and mentioned Bach and Bousquier, two notorious smugglers. &quot;The
rascals, they had better be on their guard,&quot; said the shopkeeper, &quot;and you,
Colard, come along with me; poor Fualdes is going to be buried, and it is not
fitting to be playing the flute.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Scarcely had they reached the main street, where a great
number of people had collected, when they were suddenly joined by Bousquier, who
exhibited a strange demeanor, now laughing, now shaking his head, now gazing
vacantly before him. Colard cast a shy, sidelong glance at him, and the
shopkeeper, who thought of nothing but the murder and saw in all this the
manifestations of a bad conscience, observed the man keenly. Those around them,
too, became watchful, and it at once struck everybody that if any one had a
knowledge of the crime committed in the Bancal house, it was Bousquier. The
excited Galtier questioned him bluntly. Bousquier was the worse for liquor, the
unusual hubbub intoxicated him still more; he seemed confused, but felt himself,
at the same time, a person of importance. At first he assumed an air of
unwillingness to speak out, then he related with solemn circumstantiality that
he was summoned on the night of the murder by a tobacco-dealer clad in a blue
coat; three times had the stranger sent for him, finally he went, was told to
carry a heavy bundle, and was paid with a gold piece.</p>

<p class="normal">Even while he was speaking, an expression of horror ran across
the face of the loquacious fellow; he grew gradually conscious of the
significance of his words. The listeners had formed a compact circle around him,
and a shrill voice rang out from the crowd: &quot;It was surely the corpse that was
wrapped up in that bundle!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Bousquier looked uneasy. He had to start at the beginning
again and again, and the strained glances turned upon him forced him to invent
new minor details, such as that the tobacco-dealer suddenly disappeared in an
unaccountable manner, and that his face was concealed by a black mask, &quot;Where
did you have to carry the body?&quot; asked Galtier, with clenched teeth. Bousquier,
horrified, remained silent; then, intimidated by the many threatening glances,
he replied in a low tone: &quot;Toward the river.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Two hours later he was arrested and put behind bolts and bars.
That same evening he was brought before the police magistrate, Monsieur Jausion,
and when the unfortunate man became aware that the matter was growing grave,
that his chatter was to be turned into evidence, that every word he spoke was
being noted down, and that he would have to answer for them with his freedom,
nay, perhaps with his life, he was seized with terror. He denied the story of
the tobacco-dealer and the heavy bundle, and when the magistrate grew angry,
relapsed into complete silence. On being remanded to his cell he fell into a
dull brooding. &quot;Come, wake up, Bousquier,&quot; the jailer exhorted him, &quot;you mustn't
keep the gentlemen waiting; if you are stubborn, you will have to pass some bad
nights.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Bousquier shook his head. The jailer fetched a heavy folio,
and as he himself could not read, he called another prisoner, who was made to
read aloud a passage of the law, according to which a person who was present by
compulsion at the commission of a crime, and voluntarily confessed it, would get
off with a year's imprisonment. The jailer held the lantern close to the tanned
face of the reader and nodded encouragingly to Bousquier. The latter was
mumbling the Lord's Prayer. Greatly agitated, and groping about for a way out of
his plight, he said finally that everything was as he had first related, only
the tobacco-dealer had paid him not with a gold-piece but a couple of silver
coins. He repeated his confession before the magistrate, who had been summoned
despite the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p class="normal">The next morning all Rodez knew that Bousquier had confessed
that Fualdes had been murdered in the Bancal house, and the body carried at
night to the river. Lips that had up to that time been sealed with fear were
suddenly opened. Some one, whose name could not be ascertained, declared that he
had seen some figures stealing past the house of Constans the merchant; he had
also noticed that they halted some steps further on and drew together for
consultation, whereupon, divining the horrible deed, he fled. The search for
this witness, whose voice died away so quickly amid the other voices, and yet
who was the first to trace, as with an invisible hand, a sketch of the nocturnal
funeral train, proved vain. Each one's fancy silently carried out the picture
further; they saw the body itself on the stretcher; the bier was depicted with
distinctness as if it were a concrete token of the mysterious deed; a carpenter
even drew it in chalk in bold strokes on the wall of the court-house. A woman
who suffered from insomnia stated that she was sitting at the window that night
and in spite of the darkness, recognized Bancal as well as the soldier, Colard,
who were bearing the two front handles of the bier. Furthermore, she had heard
the laborer, Missonier, who closed the procession, cursing. Summoned before the
magistrate, she fell into a contradictory mood, which was excused on the score
of her readily-comprehended excitement. But the words had been said; what weight
should be attached to them depended on the force and peculiarity of the
circumstances; the lightly spoken word weighed as heavily in the ears of the
chance auditor as if it had been his own guilt, so that he sought to free
himself of the burden and passed it on as if it would burn his tongue should he
delay but a moment. Perhaps it was this sleepless woman, perhaps the lips of
nameless Rumor herself, that enriched the picture of this murder-caravan with
the figure of a tall, broad-shouldered man, armed with a double-barreled gun,
who headed the procession. Now the gray web had a central point, and received a
sort of illumination and vividness through the probable and penetrable
criminality of a single individual. Twelve hours more, and every child knew the
exact order of the nocturnal procession: first, the tall, powerful man with the
double-barreled gun, then Bancal, Bach and Bousquier, bearing the bier, then the
humpbacked Missonier, as rear-guard. At the last houses of the town the road to
the river grew narrow and steep; as there was not room enough for two people to
walk abreast, Bousquier and Colard had to carry the body alone, and it was
Bousquier, not Missonier, who cursed, on that account, cursed so loud that the
licentiate, Coulon, was startled from his sleep and called for his servant. On
the steep place in front of the vineyards the body of the dead man was unwrapped
and thrown into the water, and when that had been done, the tall, powerful man,
pointing his gun at his confederates, imposed eternal silence upon them.</p>

<p class="normal">By this action the stranger with the double-barreled gun
emerged completely from the mist of legend and the position of a merely
picturesque accessory; his threatening attitude shed a flood of light upon the
past. What had taken place after the murder, then, had outline and life. But had
no eye accompanied poor Fualdes on his last walk? Had no one seen him leave his
house, without any foreboding, and, whistling merrily perhaps, pass through the
dark Rue de l'Ambrague, where the accomplices of the murder doubtless lay in
waiting? Yes. The same licentiate whom Bousquier's cursing had roused from his
sleep had seen the old man at eight in the evening turn into the narrow street,
and shortly after some one follow hastily behind him; whether a man or a woman,
Monsieur Coulon could not remember. Besides, a locksmith's apprentice came
forward who had observed, from the mayor's residence, some persons signaling to
each other. The mayor's dwelling was situated, it is true, in a different
quarter of the town, but that circumstance was considered of little account in
so widespun a conspiracy&#8212;had they not the testimony of a coachman who had seen
two men standing motionless in the Rue des Hebdomadiers? Many of the inhabitants
of that street now recalled that they had heard a constant whispering, hemming
and hawing, and calling, to which, being in an unsuspicious mood at the time,
they naturally paid no special heed. It was an accepted fact that watchers were
posted at every corner, nay, even a female sentinel had been observed in the
gateway of the Guildhall. The tailor, Brost, asserted that he had heard the
whispering or sighing more distinctly than any one else; he had, thereupon,
opened his window and seen five or six people enter the Bancal house, among them
the tall, powerful man. Some time after, a neighbor had observed a person being
dragged over the pavement; believing it was a girl who had drunk too much, he
attached no further significance to it. Far more important than such confused
rumors did it seem that as late as between nine and ten o'clock, an
organ-grinder was still playing in the Rue des Hebdomadiers. The purpose was
clear: it was to drown the death-cry of the victim. It soon turned out that
there must have been two organ-grinders, one of whom, a cripple, had squatted on
the curbstone in front of the Rue de l'Ambrague. To be sure, it had been the
annual fair-day in Rodez, and the presence of organ-grinders would, therefore,
not have signified anything mysterious, if the lateness of the hour had not
exposed them to suspicion. Several persons even mentioned midnight as the time
of the playing. A search was instituted for the musicians, and the villages in
the vicinity were scoured for them, but they had disappeared as completely as
the suspicious tobacco-dealer.</p>

<p class="normal">On the same morning when the Bancal house was searched and a
policeman found a white cloth with dark spots in the yard, the Bancals, Bach,
and the laborer Missonier, were taken into custody and, loaded with chains, were
thrown into prison. Staring vacantly before them, the five men sat in the police
wagon, which, followed by a crowd of people, chattering, cursing, and clenching
their fists, carried them through the streets. The report of the cloth
discovered in the yard spread in an instant; that the spots were blood-spots
admitted no doubt; that it had been used to gag Fualdes was a matter of course.</p>

<p class="normal">Meanwhile Bousquier, all unstrung by his miserable plight,
dragged from one hearing to another, alarmed by threats, racked by hunger,
enticed by hopes of freedom and illusory promises, had confessed more and more
daily. He was driven by the jailer, he was driven by the magistrate; for the
latter felt the impatience and fury of the people, and the fables of the press,
like the lash of a whip. Bousquier had seemed to be stubborn; but the
presentation of his former stories, which now, like creditors, extorted an
ever-increasing usurious interest of lies, sufficed to render him tractable. He
appeared to be worn out, to be incapable of expressing what he had seen, of
describing what he had heard,&#8212;Monsieur Jausion assisted him by questions which
contained the required answers.</p>

<p class="normal">Thus he admitted that he had gone into the Bancal house, and
found the Bancals, the soldier Colard, the smuggler Bach, two young women, and a
veiled lady in the room. The more persons he mentioned, the more conciliatory
grew the countenance of the magistrate, and, as though into the jaws of a hungry
beast, he continued unconcernedly throwing him bit after bit. He probably
recalled other nights spent in the motley company, and it struck him that the
person of the veiled lady would be an addition which might enhance his credit.
Monsieur Jausion found, however, that an important figure was lacking, and he
asked in a stern tone whether Bousquier had not forgotten somebody. Bousquier
was startled and pondered. &quot;Try your best to remember,&quot; urged the magistrate;
&quot;what you conceal may turn into a rope for your neck. Speak out, then: was there
not a tall, robust man present also?&quot; Bousquier realized that this new person
must be included. One shadowy shape after another, wild, fantastic, started up
in his distracted brain, and he had to let the puppets play, to satisfy his
tormentor. To the question of how the tall, powerful man looked and how he was
dressed, he answered: &quot;Like a gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And now it was his turn to describe, to vivify the scene of
action. On the large table in Bancal's room there lay, not the bundle of tobacco
for which he had been called, but a corpse. He tried to flee, but the tall,
robust man followed him and threatened him with a pistol.</p>

<p class="normal">The magistrate shook his head reproachfully. &quot;With a pistol?&quot;
he said. &quot;Think well, Bousquier, was it not a gun, perhaps? was it not a
double-barreled gun?&quot; &quot;All right,&quot; reflected Bousquier, infuriated; &quot;if they are
bent upon a gun, it may just as well have been a gun.&quot; He nodded as if ashamed,
and went on to say that, his life being thus threatened, he was obliged to
remain in Bancal's chamber and aid and abet him. The dead man was wrapped in a
linen cloth, bound with ropes, and placed upon the stretcher. The stretcher was
constructed, in Bousquier's imagination, aided by the turnkey, with the utmost
perfection. When he was about to describe the funeral train, however, the
tortured man lost consciousness, and when, late in the evening, he was again
conducted to the hearing&#8212;rarely did the night and the candle-light in the dreary
room fail of their spectral effects&#8212;he unexpectedly denied everything, cried,
screamed, and acted as if completely bereft of his senses. In order to encourage
and calm him. Monsieur Jausion resorted to a measure as bold as it was simple;
he said that Bach and Colard had likewise made a confession, and it was
gratifying that their declarations coincided with those of Bousquier; if he
comported himself sensibly now, he would soon be allowed to leave the prison.</p>

<p class="normal">Bousquier was startled. The longer he reflected, the more
profoundly was he impressed by what he had heard. His face blanched and he grew
cold all over. It was as if a disordered dream were suddenly turned into a
waking reality, or as if a person in a state of semi-intoxication, recounting
the fictitious story of some misfortune and becoming more and more enmeshed in a
web of falsehoods with every new detail, suddenly learned that everything had
actually taken place as he had related. A peculiar depression took possession of
him, he had a horror of the solitude of his cell, a dread of sleep.</p>

<p class="normal">All Rodez had listened to Bousquier's statements with feverish
avidity. Finally the form of the stranger with the double-barreled gun obtained
distinctness and tangibility. That he had the air of a gentleman spurred the
rage of the people, and the Legitimist party, which was composed in great part
of the rich and the aristocracy, began to tremble. It was probably among them
that a person was first mentioned whose name ran, first cautiously, then boldly,
then accusingly, from mouth to mouth, and over whose head a thunder-cloud, born
of a wreath of mist, hung arrested, quivering with lightning. It was well known
that Bastide Grammont, the tenant of La Morne, in spite of his relationship to
the lawyer Fualdes, lived in a state of animosity, or at least of the oppressive
dependence of a debtor, with the old man. Every one knew, or thought he knew,
that stormy scenes had often taken place between uncle and nephew. Was not that
enough? Moreover, Bastide's domineering temperament and harsh nature, the sudden
sale of La Morne, and a well connected chain of little suspicious signs&#8212;who
still dared to doubt?</p>

<p class="normal">The unwearied architect who was at work somewhere there, in
the earth below or the air above, took care that the circle of ruin should be
complete, and enlisted associates with malicious pleasure in every street, among
high and low. In the forenoon of the nineteenth of March, Fualdes and Grammont
were walking up and down the promenade of Rodez. A woman who dealt in
second-hand things had heard the young fellow say to the old man: &quot;This evening,
then, at eight o'clock.&quot; A mason who was shoveling sand for a new building had
heard Monsieur Fualdes exclaim: &quot;You will keep your word, then?&quot; Whereupon
Grammont replied: &quot;Set your mind at rest, this evening I shall settle my account
with you.&quot; The music-teacher Lacombe remembered distinctly how Bastide, with a
wrathful countenance, had called to the old man: &quot;You drive me to extremity.&quot;
The idle talk of a chatterbox gained, in the buzz of hearsay, the same
importance as well established observations, and what had been said before and
after was blended and combined with audacious arbitrariness. Thus, Professor
Vignet, one of the heads of the Royalists, alleged that he had gone into a fruit
store about seven in the evening, shortly before the murder, and met one of his
colleagues there. He related that he had seen Bastide Grammont, who was walking
rather rapidly on passing him. He declared that he exclaimed: &quot;Don't you find
that Grammont has an uncanny face?&quot; To which the other answered affirmatively
and said that one must be on one's guard against him. Witnesses came forward who
confirmed this conversation. Witnesses came forward who claimed to have seen
Bastide in front of the Bancal house; he had emitted a shrill whistle a number
of times and then dodged into the shadow.</p>

<p class="normal">Bastide Grammont had lived at La Morne for five years. He was
perhaps the only man in the entire district who never concerned himself about
politics, and kept aloof from all party activity, and this proud independence
exposed him to the ill will, nay, the hatred, of his fellow-citizens. When upon
one occasion a demonstration in favor of the Bourbons was to take place in
Rodez, and the streets were filled with an excited crowd, he rode with grave
coolness on his dapple-gray horse through the inflamed throng and returned the
wild, angry glances directed at him with a supercilious smile.</p>

<p class="normal">It was related of him that he had wasted his youth and a
considerable fortune in Paris, and had returned home from there sick and tired
of mankind. His mode of life pointed to a love of the singular. In former years
a learned father from the neighboring Benedictine abbey had often been his
guest; it seemed as if the quiet student of human nature took a secret pleasure
in the unbridled spirit and the pagan fervor of Nature-worship of the hermit,
Bastide; but when he forcibly abducted a seamstress, pretty Charlotte Arlabosse,
from Alby, and lived with her in unlawful union, the Benedictine, in obedience
to the command of his superiors, was obliged to break off the intercourse.
Thenceforth, Bastide renounced all intimate human contact. He had no friend; he
wished for none. He secluded himself with disdainful pride; the sight of a new
face turned his distant and cold; people in society he treated with insulting
indifference. Perhaps it was only from a fear of disappointment that he harshly
withstood even the most friendly advances, for there lay at times a vague
yearning for love in the depths of his eyes. To grow hard because unfulfilled
claims afflict and darken the soul, to retire into solitude because overweening
pride shuns to lay bare the glowing heart, to be unjust from a feeling of shame
and misunderstood defiance&#8212;that was perhaps his lot, and certainly his
shortcoming.</p>

<p class="normal">For days at a time he would roam about with his dogs in the
valleys of the Cévennes. He gathered stones, mushrooms, flowers, caught birds
and snakes, hunted, sang, and fished. If something went wrong and his blood was
up, he mounted the fieriest horse in his stable and rode over the most dangerous
paths across the rocks, to Rieux. In winter, in the early cold hours, he was
seen bathing in the river; in sultry summer nights he lay naked and feverish
under the open sky. He declared then that he saw the stars dance and the earth
tremble. At vintage time he was, without ever drinking, as if intoxicated; he
organized festivals with music and torch-light processions, and was the patron
of all the love-affairs among the workers in the vineyards. In case of
long-continued bad weather he grew pale, languid, and supersensitive, lost sleep
and appetite, and was subject to sudden fits of rage which were the dread of his
servants; on one such occasion he cut down half a dozen of the grandest trees in
the garden, which, as everybody knew, he loved as passionately as if they were
his brothers.</p>

<p class="normal">That with such an irregular management the income of the
estate diminished year by year, astonished no one but himself. He fell into
debt, but to speak or think about it caused him the greatest annoyance, and his
resource against it was a regular participation in various lotteries, to whose
dates of payment he always looked forward with childish impatience.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="space">* * * * *</span></p>

<p class="normal">When the court, in compliance with the opinion and accusation
of the people, which could not be ignored, ordered Bastide's arrest, he already
knew the forces at work against him. He was sitting under a huge plane-tree,
occupied with some wood-carving, when the constables appeared in the yard.
Charlotte Arlabosse rushed up to him and seized his arm, but he shook her off,
saying: &quot;Let them have their way, the abscess has been ripe a long time.&quot;
Stepping forward to meet the gendarmes with satirical pomposity, he cried: &quot;Your
servant, gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The occupants of La Morne were subjected to a rigorous
examination. According to Bastide's own statement, he had ridden to Rodez on the
afternoon of the nineteenth of March; at seven in the evening he was already
with his sister in the village of Gros; there he remained over night, returned
in the morning to La Morne, then upon the news of his uncle's death, he had
ridden to Rodez once more and spent about half an hour in Fualdes' house. His
sister confirmed his statement that he had passed the night in her house, and
added that he had been particularly cheerful and amiable. The maid, too, who had
waited on him and prepared his bed, declared that he had retired at ten o'clock.
As to the domestics at La Morne, they babbled of one thing and another. In order
to say something and not stand there like simpletons or accomplices, they
involved themselves in speeches of significant obscurity; thus one of the
servants remarked that if the master's gray mare could but speak he could tell
of some hard riding that night. The maids spoke incoherently or shed tears;
Charlotte Arlabosse even fled, but was captured in the vineyards and
incarcerated in the town prison.</p>

<p class="normal">These occurrences were by no means concealed from Bousquier
and his associates; nay, insignificant details were emphatically dwelt upon, in
order to give them a sense of security and assist their memory. It was the
smuggler Bach, in particular&#8212;who, with the Bancal couple, could not at first be
induced to make a statement&#8212;that the police magistrate had in view. He had
terrified judges and keepers by his violent paroxysms of rage, and, to punish
and subdue him, had been put in chains. Unconscious of it himself, this man
suffered from a fierce longing for freedom, for he was the model of a roving
vagabond and tramp. One night when he had attempted to strangle himself.
Monsieur Jausion acquainted him with the confession of his comrade, Bousquier,
and admonished him too to abandon his fruitless stubbornness. Thereupon the
demeanor of the man changed at once; he became cheerful and communicative, and,
grinning maliciously, said: &quot;All right, if Bousquier knows much, I know still
more.&quot; And in fact, he did know more. He was a stammerer and took advantage of
this defect to gain time for reflection when his imagination halted, and every
time he strayed into the regions of the fabulous the keen-witted Monsieur
Jausion led him gently back to the path of reality.</p>

<p class="normal">This was his story: When he entered the room with Bousquier,
lawyer Fualdes was seated at the table, and was made to sign papers. The tall,
powerful man, Bastide Grammont, of course&#8212;no doubt it was Grammont; Bach in this
relied upon the information of the magistrate and upon glib Rumor&#8212;stuck the
signed papers in his pocket-book. In the meanwhile Madame Bancal cooked a
supper, chicken with vegetables, and veal with rice; an important detail,
indicating the cold-bloodedness of the murderers. Shortly before eight o'clock
two drummers came in, but the face of the host or of the strange gentleman
displeased them; they thought they were in the way and left, whereupon the gate
was locked. But there was a knocking several times after that; the preconcerted
signal was three rapid knocks with the fist, and one after the other there
entered the soldier Colard with his sweetheart, the humpbacked Missonier, an
aristocratic looking veiled lady with green feathers in her hat, and a
tobacco-dealer in a blue coat. The hat with the green feathers was a special
proof of Bach's powers of invention, and stood out with picturesque
verisimilitude against the blue-coated tobacconist.</p>

<p class="normal">At half past eight Madame Bancal went up to the attic to put
her daughter Madeleine to bed, and now Bastide Grammont explained to the old man
that he must die. The imploring supplications of the victim resulted only in the
powerful Bastide seizing him, and, in spite of his violent resistance, laying
him on the table, from which Bancal hastily removed two loaves of bread which
some one had brought along. Fualdes begged pitifully that he might be given time
to reconcile himself with God, but Bastide Grammont replied gruffly: &quot;Reconcile
yourself with the devil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Here M. Jausion interrupted the relation, and inquired whether
a hand-organ had not perchance at that moment commenced to play in front of the
house. Bach eagerly confirmed the supposition, and continued his report, which
now wrought up the narrator himself to a pitch of excitement and horror: Colard
and Bancal held the old man's legs, while the tobacconist and his sweetheart
seized his head and arms. A gentleman with a wooden leg and a three-cornered hat
held a candle high in the air. There was something weird about the emergence of
this new figure; if it stood for nothing more than a finishing touch to the
horror of that night of murder, it fulfilled its aim to perfection. The
wooden-legged man uplifting the candle was like an impious spirit from the
nether world, and it was not necessary to dwell upon the narrow chin, the
sneering mouth, the spectral eye.</p>

<p class="normal">With a broad knife Bastide Grammont gave the old man a stab;
Fualdes, by a superhuman effort, succeeded in breaking loose; he sprang up and
ran, already mortally wounded, through the room; Bastide Grammont, pursuing,
seized hold of him, threw him again on the table, the table rocked, one leg
broke; now the dying man was placed upon two benches rapidly moved close to each
other, and Bastide Grammont thrust the knife into his throat. With the last
groan of the old man, Bancal came and his wife caught up the flowing blood in an
earthen pot; the part that ran on the floor was scrubbed up by the women. In the
pockets of the murdered man a five franc piece and several sous were found.
Bastide Grammont threw the money into the apron of the Bancal woman, saying:
&quot;Take it! We are not killing him for his money.&quot; A key, too, was found; that
Bastide kept. Madame Bancal had a hankering for the fine shirt of the dead man,
and remarked covetously that it looked like a chorister's shirt; she was
diverted from her desire, however, on being presented with an amethyst ring on
Fualdes' finger. This ring was taken away the following day by a stranger for a
consideration of ten francs.</p>

<p class="normal">When Bach's recital with all its circumstantiality and its
simulated completeness of strange and illuminating details became known, there
lacked but little to hailing the imaginative scamp as a deliverer. Indignation
fed belief, and criticism seemed treason. The public, the witnesses, the judges,
the authorities, all believed in the deed and all began to join in invention.
Bach and Bousquier, who were confronted with each other, quarreled and called
each other liars; one claimed that lie had gone into the Bancal house before,
the other after, the murder; one declared that he had assisted in the deed, the
other that he had only lifted the body, which was wrapped in a sheet and bound
with ropes. The half-witted Missonnier designated still another batch of persons
whom he had seen in the Bancal house, two notaries from Alby and a cook. In Rose
Feral's tavern, where all sorts of shady characters congregated, and old warlike
exploits and thieveries were the subjects of discussion, on the night of the
murder the talk fell upon the pillaging of a house, the property of a Liberal.
This report was designed to heighten the apprehension of the quiet citizens, and
that afterward all the conspirators, even well-to-do people, met in Bancal's
house gave no cause for astonishment. Everything harmonized in the intricate,
devilish plot; in the clothes of the dead Fualdes no money, on his fingers no
ring, had been found; Grammont had the bailiff in his house as late as the
seventeenth of March, and this circumstance, singled out at an opportune moment
from the quagmire of lies, inspired security. Bastide was hopelessly entangled.
The prisoners were thrown into a panic by the palpable agitation of the people;
each one appeared guilty in the other's eyes, each one was ready to admit
anything that was desired concerning the other, in order to exonerate himself;
they were ignorant of their fate, they lost all sense of the meaning of words,
they were no longer conscious of themselves, their bodies, their souls; they
felt themselves encompassed by invisible clasps, and each sought to free himself
on his own account, without knowing what he had actually done or failed to do.
Every day new arrests were made, no traveler passing through was sure of his
freedom, and after a few weeks half of France was seized with the intoxication
of rage, a craving for revenge, and fear. Of the figures of the
ludicrously-gruesome murder imbroglio, now this, now that one emerged with
greater distinctness and reality, and the one that stood out finally as the most
important, because her name was constantly brought forward, was the veiled lady
with the green feather in her hat; nay, she gradually became the centre and
impelling power of the bloody deed, perhaps only because her origin and
existence remained a mystery. Many raised their voices in suspicion against
Charlotte Arlabosse, but she was able to establish her innocence by well-nigh
unassailable testimony; besides, she appeared too harmless and too much like a
victim of Bastide's tyrannical cruelty, to answer to the demoniacal picture of
the mysterious unknown.</p>

<p class="normal">While Bach and Bousquier, in a rivalry which hastened their
own ruin, tempted the authorities to clemency by ever new inventions, and,
encouraged by the gossip which filtered through to them by subterranean
channels, disturbed further the already troubled waters; while the soldier
Colard and the Bancal couple, owing to the rigorous confinement, the harsh
treatment of the keepers, and the excruciating hearings, were thrown into
paroxysms of insanity, so that they reported things which even Jausion, used as
he was to extravagance, had to characterize as the mere phantoms of a dream;
while the other prisoners, steering unsteadily between their actual experiences
and morbid visions, constantly suspected each other, and retracted today what
they had sworn to yesterday, now whined for mercy, now maintained a defiant
silence; while the inhabitants of the city, the villages, the whole province,
demanded the termination of the long-winded procedure and the punishment of the
evil-doers, with a fanaticism whose fire was tended and fed by mysterious
agents; while, finally, the court, in the uncontrollably increasing flood of
accusations and calumnies, lost its sense of direction, and was gradually
becoming a tool in the hands of the populace;&#8212;in the meanwhile the boundless
forces at work succeeded in poisoning the mind of a child, who appeared as a
witness against father and mother, and led the deluded people to believe that
God himself had by a miracle loosened the tongue of an infant.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="pix_20" href="#pixRef_20"><img src="images/wassermann.png" alt="Jakob_Wassermann"></a></p>
<p class="center">JAKOB WASSERMANN</p>

<p class="normal">At the outset the eleven-year-old Madeleine Bancal had been
questioned by the police magistrate; she knew nothing. Subsequently the child
came to the tavern, and at once people came forward who had heard from others,
who again had heard from third or fourth parties, that the girl had seen the old
man laid upon the table and her mother receiving money. Of course it was
ascertained by Counselor Pinaud, the only man who retained clarity and judgment
in the wild confusion, that Madeleine had taken presents from the managers of
the tavern, as well as from other people; but it was too late by that time to
discover and extirpate the root of the lie. She was persuaded ever more firmly
into a belief of her first statement, and the recital kept expanding the greater
the attention paid her, the more her vanity was flattered, until she believed
she had really witnessed all that she related, and she experienced a feeling of
satisfaction in the sympathy and pity of the grown people. Her mother had taken
her to the attic, so she reported, but fearing the cold, she had stealthily
crept downstairs and hidden herself in the bed in the alcove. Through a hole in
the curtain she could see and hear everything. When the old man was about to be
stabbed, the lady with the green feather ran terrified into the room and
attempted to escape through the window. Bastide Grammont dragged her forth and
wanted to kill her. Bancal and Colard begged him to spare her, and she had to
swear an awful oath which pledged her to silence. A little later, Grammont,
whose suspicions were not silenced, examined the bed also. Madeleine pretended
to be asleep. He felt her twice, and then said to the mother that she must
attend to getting rid of the child, which Madame Bancal promised to do for a sum
of four hundred francs. The next morning the mother sent the child to the field,
where the father had just dug a deep hole. She thought her father meant to throw
her in, but he embraced her, weeping, and admonished her to be good.</p>

<p class="normal">Even if people had been ready to doubt every other testimony,
the report of the child passed as irrefutable, and no one concerned himself as
to how it had been concocted, how the ignorant young thing had been courted,
bribed, how she had been intoxicated by fondling, applause, or, it may be, even
by fear. She was dragged from her sleep at night, in order to take advantage of
her bewilderment; every new fancy was welcomed, the girl thought she was doing
something remarkable, and played her part with increasing readiness. In such
wise she molded out of nothing things which were calculated to throw a
singularly realistic light upon the fevered image of the fateful night; for
instance, how the mother had cut bread with the same knife with which the old
gentleman had been stabbed, and how Madeleine had refused the bread, because it
made her shudder; or how the blood, caught up in the pan, had been given to one
of the pigs to drink, and how the animal had become wild in consequence, and had
rushed, screaming madly, through the yard.</p>

<p class="normal">Bastide Grammont bore hearing after hearing with a cold
placidity. His frigidly haughty dignity, his mocking smile, the mute shrug of
his shoulders, caused Monsieur Jausion frequent annoyance. But there were times
when, carried away by impatience, he interrupted the judge outright, and
attacked, boldly and eloquently, the frail yet indestructible structure of the
evidence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If it was my intention and interest to do away with my uncle,
did it require a conspiracy of so many people?&quot; he asked, his face blazing with
scorn. &quot;Am I supposed to have such a combination of craft and stupidity as to
ally myself with brothel-keepers, harlots, smugglers, old women, and convicted
criminals, people who would, as long as I live, remain my masters and
blackmailers, even supposing silence to be among their virtues? Can anything
more senseless be imagined than to seize a man on an open road and drag him into
a house known to be suspicious? Why all this elaborate plot? Did no better
occasion offer itself to me? Could I not have enticed the old man to the estate,
shot him and buried him in the woods? It is claimed that I forced him to sign
bills,&#8212;where are they, these bills? They would be bound to turn up and expose
me. You say yourself that the Bancal house is dilapidated, that one can look
into Bancal's room from the Spaniards' dwelling through the rotten boards; why,
then, did Monsieur Saavedra hear nothing! Aha, he slept! A sound sleep, that. Or
is he likewise, in the conspiracy, like my mother, my sister, my sweetheart, my
faithful servants? And admitting all, were not the Bancal couple sufficient to
help kill a feeble old man and dispose of his body; did I have to fetch half a
dozen suspicious fellows, besides, from the taverns? Why did not my uncle cry
out? He was gagged; well and good; but the gag was found in the yard. Then he
did scream, after all, when the gag was removed, and I had the organ-grinders
play. But such organs are noisy and draw people to the windows and into the
street. And why butcher the victim, since so many strong men could easily have
strangled him? Show me the medical report. Monsieur, does it not speak of a gash
rather than a stab? And what twaddle, that about the funeral train, what
betraying arrangements in a country where every sign-post has eyes! I am accused
of having rushed into my uncle's house the following day and stolen some papers.
Where are those papers? My uncle died almost poor. His claim against me was
transferred to President Seguret. Why, then, the deed? What do they want with
me? Who that has eyes sees my hands stained?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This language was defiant. It aroused the displeasure of the
court and increased the hatred of the multitude, whom it reached in garbled
shape. Through fear of the people, no lawyer dared undertake Bastide Grammont's
defense. Monsieur Pinaud, who alone had the courage to point out the
improbabilities and the fantastic origin of most of the testimony, came near
paying with his life for his zeal for truth. One night a mob, including some
peasants, marched to his house, smashed his windows, demolished the gate, and
set fire to the steps. The terrified man made his escape with difficulty, and
fled to Toulouse.</p>

<p class="normal">Bastide Grammont clearly recognized that, for the present, it
was useless to offer any resistance; he determined, therefore, to transform all
his valor into patience and keep his lips closed as if they were doors through
which his hopes might take flight. He, the freest of men, had to pass the
radiant spring days, the fragrant summer nights, in a damp hole which rendered
one's own breath offensive; he, to whom animals spoke, for whom flowers had
eyes, the earth at times a semblance of the glow of love, who walked, strode,
roamed, rode, as artists produce enchanting creations&#8212;he was condemned by the
perverse play of incomprehensible circumstances to a foretaste of the grave and
deprived of what he held dearest and most precious. Frequent grew the nights of
sullenness when his eyes, brimming over with tears, were dulled at the thought
of disgrace; more frequent the days of irrepressible longing, when every grain
of sand that crumbled from the moist walls was a reminder of the wondrous being
and working of the earth, the meadow, the wood. From the events which had
overshadowed his life he turned away his thoughts in disgust, and he scarcely
heard the keeper when he appeared one morning and exultingly informed him that
the mysterious unknown, who was destined to become the chief witness, the lady
with the green feathers, had finally been found; she had come forward of her own
accord, and she was the daughter of President Seguret, Clarissa Mirabel.</p>

<p class="normal">Bastide Grammont gazed gloomily before him. But from that hour
that name hovered about his ears like the fluttering of the wings of inevitable
Fate.</p>

<hr class="W10">

<p class="normal">This is what took place: Madame Mirabel confessed that on the
night of the murder she had been in the Bancal house. This confession, however,
was made under a peculiar stress, and in less time than it took swift Rumor to
make it public, she retracted everything. But the word had fallen and bred deed
upon deed.</p>

<p class="normal">Clarissa Mirabel was the only child of President Seguret. She
was brought up in the country, in the old Château Perrié, which her father had
bought at the outbreak of the Revolution. Owing to the political upheavals, and
the uncertain condition of things, she did not enjoy the benefit of any regular
instruction in her childhood. The profound isolation in which she grew up
favored her inclination to romanticism. She idolized her parents; in the
agitated period of anarchy, the girl, scarcely fourteen years old, exhibited at
her father's side such a spirit of self-sacrifice and such devotion that she
aroused the attention of Colonel Mirabel, who, five years later, came and sued
for her hand. She did not love him,&#8212;she had shortly before entered into a
singularly romantic relationship with a shepherd,&#8212;yet she married him, because
her father bade her. The union was not happy; after three months she separated
from her husband; the Colonel went with the army to Spain. At the conclusion of
the war he returned, and Clarissa received an intimation of his desire that she
should live with him; she refused, however, and declared her refusal, moreover,
in writing, incensed that he should have sent strangers to negotiate with her.
But she learned that he was wounded, and this caused a revulsion of feeling. In
the night, by secret passages, with ceremonious formalities, the Colonel was
carried into the château, and Clarissa tended him, in a remote chamber, with
faithful care. As long as it remained secret, the new sort of relationship to
the man as a lover fascinated her, but her mother discovered everything and
believed that nothing stood in the way of a complete reconciliation between the
pair. Clarissa succeeded in removing him; in a thicket near the village she had
nightly rendezvous with him. Colonel Mirabel, however, grew weary of these
singular doings; he obtained a position in Lyons, but died soon after from the
consequences of his excesses.</p>

<p class="normal">Years passed; her mother, too, died, and Clarissa's grief was
so overwhelming that she would spend entire days at the grave, and the influence
of her more readily consoled father alone succeeded in inducing her to reconcile
herself to her lonely, empty existence. Left completely to herself, she indulged
in the pleasure of indiscriminate reading, and her wishes turned, with hidden
passion, toward great experiences. Her peculiar tastes and habits made her a
subject of gossip in the little town; she had children and half-grown boys and
girls come to the château, and recited poems to them and trained them for
acting. Her frank nature created enemies; she said what she thought, offended
with no ill intention, caused confusion and gossip in all innocence, exaggerated
petty things and overlooked great ones, took pleasure at times in masking,
appearing in disguise, and impersonating imaginary characters, and captivated
the susceptible by the charm of her speech, the bright versatility of her
spirit, the winning heartiness of her manner.</p>

<p class="normal">She was now thirty-five years old; but not only because she
was so exceedingly slender, small, and dainty, did she seem like a girl of
eighteen&#8212;her nature, too, was permeated by a rare spirit of youth; and when her
eye rested, absorbed and contemplative, upon an object, it had the clearness and
dreamy sweetness of the gaze of a child. She was a product of the border:
southern vivacity and northern gravity had resulted in a restless mixture; she
was fond of musing, and, playful as a young animal, was capable of arousing in
men of all sorts desire mingled with shyness.</p>

<p class="normal">The flood of reports concerning the death of the lawyer
Fualdes left her, at first, unmoved, although her father, by his purchase of the
domain of La Morne, seemed directly interested in the happenings, and new
accounts were brought to the château daily. The occurrence was too complicated
for her, and everything connected with it smelt too much of the unclean. Only
when the name of Bastide Grammont was first mentioned did she prick up her ears,
follow the affair, and have her father or the servants report to her the
supposed course of events, displaying more interest than astonishment.</p>

<p class="normal">She knew nothing about Bastide Grammont. Nevertheless, his
name, as soon as she heard it, fell like a weight upon her watchful soul. She
began to make inquiries about him, ventured upon secret rides to La Morne, and
led one or another of his servants to talk about him; nay, once she even
succeeded in speaking with Charlotte Arlabosse, who was free again at that time.
What she learned aroused a strange, pained astonishment; she had a feeling of
having missed an important meeting.</p>

<p class="normal">In addition, she suddenly remembered having seen him. It must
have been he, if she but half comprehended the confused descriptions of his
person. It was a year ago, one early morning in the first days of spring. Seized
by the general unrest with which the vernal season stirs the blood and rouses
the sleeper sooner than his wont, she had wandered from the château, over the
vine-clad hills, into the woody vale of Rolx. And as she strode through the dewy
underbrush glistening with sunshine, above her the warbling of birds and the
glowing blue of the celestial dome, beneath her the earth breathing like a
sentient being, she caught sight of a man of powerful build who was standing
erect, bareheaded, with nose in the air, and was enjoying with a preternatural
eagerness, with distended gaze, all that lay open for enjoyment&#8212;the scents, the
sun, the intoxicating dewiness, the splendor of the heavens. He seemed to scent
it all, sniffing like a dog or a deer, and while his upturned face bore an
expression of unfettered, smiling satisfaction, his arms, hanging by his side,
trembled as in a spasm.</p>

<p class="normal">She was frightened then; she fled without his perceiving her,
without his hearing the sound of her footsteps. Now the picture assumed a
different significance. Often when she was alone she would abandon herself to a
fancied image of that hour: how she had gone forward to meet the singular being,
and by skilfully planned questions beguiled answer upon answer from his stubborn
lips, and how, unable to disguise his feelings any longer, he had spontaneously
opened his heart to her. And one night he came riding on a wild steed, forced
his way into the castle, took her and rode away with her so swiftly that it
seemed as if the storm was his servant, and lent wings to his steed. When the
talk at table or in company turned upon Bastide Grammont and his murderous
crime, of which no one stood in doubt, Clarissa never occupied herself with the
enormity of the deed, which must forever separate such a man from the fellowship
of the good. Enveloped in a voluptuous mist, she was sensible of the influence
of his compelling force, of the heroic soul that spoke in his gestures, of the
reality of his existence and the possibility of a close approach to the figure
which persisted in haunting her troubled dreams. She was frightened at herself;
she gazed into the dreaded depths of her soul, and she often felt as if she
herself were lying in prison and Bastide were walking back and forth outside,
planning means for forcing the door, while his swift steed was neighing in
triumph.</p>

<p class="normal">Now she was entangled in all the talk, whisperings, and tales,
and the whole mass of abominations, too, in which design and arbitrariness were
hopelessly mingled, passed, steadily growing, before her. The thing had an
increasingly strange effect upon her, and she felt as if she were breathing
poisoned air; she would walk through one of the streets of Rodez and fancy that
all eyes were fastened upon her in accusation, so that she hastened her steps,
hurried home, pale and confused, and gazed at herself in the mirror with
faltering pulse.</p>

<p class="normal">She had recently been entertained at the estate of a family on
terms of friendship with her father. One day the master of the house, a scholar,
was thrown into great agitation over the loss of a valuable manuscript. The
servants were ordered to ransack every room, but no one was suspected of theft.
Clarissa fell by and by into a painful state; she imagined that she was
suspected; in every word she felt a sting, in every look a question; she took
part in the search with anxious zeal, fevered visions of prison and disgrace
already floated before her, she longed to hasten to her father, to assert her
innocence&#8212;when suddenly the manuscript was found under some old books; Clarissa
breathed again as if saved from peril of death, and never before had she been as
witty, talkative, and captivatingly lovable as in the hours that followed.</p>

<p class="normal">When in the imagination of the multitude the lady with the
green feathers grew steadily more distinct, along with the other figures
implicated in the brutal slaughter of poor Fualdes, Clarissa was thrown into a
consternation with which she only trifled at first, as if to test herself in a
probability or balance herself upon a possibility, like a lad who with a
pleasing shudder ventures upon the frozen surface of a stream to test its
firmness. She devoured the reports in the newspapers. The timorous dallying grew
into a haunting idea, chiefly owing to the fact that she really was the
possessor of a hat with green feathers. That circumstance could not be regarded
as remarkable. Fashion permitted the use of green, yellow, or red feathers;
nevertheless, the possession of the hat became a torment to Clarissa. She dared
no longer touch it; it seemed to her as if the feathers were enveloped in a
bloody lustre, and she finally hid it in a lumber-room under the roof. She
busied herself with plans of travel, and meant to visit Paris; but her
resolution grew more shaky every day. Meanwhile June set in. A traveling
theatrical company gave a number of performances in Rodez, and an officer by the
name of Clemendot, who had long been pursuing Clarissa with declarations of
love, but who had always, on account of his commonplaceness and evident crudity,
been coolly, nay, at times ignominiously repulsed, brought her a ticket and
invited her to accompany him to the theatre. She declined, but at the last
moment she felt a desire to go, and had to suffer Captain Clemendot's taking the
vacant seat to her right, after the rise of the curtain.</p>

<p class="normal">The troupe presented a melodrama, whose action dragged out at
great length and with great gusto the misfortune and gruesome murder of an
innocent youth. At the close of the last act a woman disguised as a man appeared
upon the scene; she wore a pointed round hat, and a mask covered her face. A
hurried love-scene, carried on in whispers, by the light of the dismal lamp of a
criminal quarter, with the chief of the band of murderers, sealed the fate of
the unhappy victim, who was kneeling in prayer. In the house an eager silence
reigned, all eyes were burning. Clarissa seemed to hear the hundred hearts beat
like so many hammers; she grew hot and cold, every feeling of the real present
vanished, and when, in the ensuing interval. Captain Clemendot in his half
humble, half impudent way became importunate, a shudder ran through her body,
and at the fumes of wine which he exhaled she came near fainting. Suddenly she
threw back her head, fixed her gaze upon his muddled, besotted countenance and
asked in a low, sharp, hurried tone: &quot;What would you say, Captain, if it were
I&#8212;I&#8212;who was present at the Bancal house?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Captain Clemendot turned pale. His mouth opened slowly, his
cheeks quivered, his eyes glistened with fear, and when Clarissa broke into a
soft, mocking, but not quite natural, laugh, he rose and, with an embarrassed
farewell, left her. He was a simple man, as illiterate as a drummer, and, like
everybody else in Rodez, completely under the sway of the blood-curdling
reports. When the performance was at an end, he approached Clarissa, who, with
an impassive air, was making her way to the exit, and asked whether she had been
trying to jest with him, and she, her lips dry, and something like a prying
hatred in her eyes, answered, laughing again: &quot;No, no, Captain.&quot; After that her
face resumed its earnest, almost sad, expression and her head dropped on her
breast.</p>

<p class="normal">Clemendot went home with a disturbed mind, thoroughly
convinced that he had received an important confession. He felt in duty bound to
speak out, and unbosomed himself next morning to a comrade. The latter drew a
second friend into the secret, they deliberated together, and by noon the
magistrate had been informed. Monsieur Jausion had the Captain and Madame
Mirabel summoned. After long and singular reflection Clarissa declared that the
whole thing was a joke, and the magistrate was obliged to dismiss her for the
present.</p>

<p class="normal">It was not joking, however, that the gentlemen wanted, but
earnest. The Prefect, advised of what had happened, called in the evening on
President Seguret and had a brief interview with the worthy man, who, shaken to
his inmost soul, had to learn what a disgrace, to himself and her, his daughter
had conjured up, menacing thus the peace of his old age. Clarissa was called in;
she stood as if deprived of life before the two aged men, and the grief which
spoke in her father's every motion and feature struck her heart with sorrow. She
pleaded the thoughtlessness of the moment, the mad humor and confusion of her
mind; in vain, the Prefect openly showed his incredulity. Monsieur Seguret, who
in spite of his fondness for a jovial life, was of an exceedingly suspicious
disposition, lacking, too, a firm and clear judgment of men, could not help
regarding the depressed spirits of his daughter as a proof of guilt, and he
explained to her, with cutting severity, that the truth alone would keep him
from thrusting her from his heart. Clarissa ceased speaking; words rushed in
upon her like destroying demons. The President grew sleepless and agitated, and
wandered, distracted, about the castle all night long. His reflections consisted
in fathoming Clarissa's nature on the side of its awful possibilities, and he
very soon saw her impenetrable character covered with the blots and stigmas of
the vice of romanticism. He, too, was completely under the spell of the general
fanatical opinion, his experience could not hold out against the poisoned breath
of calumny; the fear of being connected with the monstrous deed was stronger
than the voice of his heart; suspicion became certainty, denial a lie. When he
reflected upon Clarissa's past, her ungovernable desire to desert the beaten
paths&#8212;a quality which appeared to him now as the gate to crime&#8212;no assumption was
too daring, and her image interwove itself in the dismal web.</p>

<p class="normal">Sleep was banished from Clarissa, too. She surprised her
father in the gray morning hours in his disturbed wanderings through the rooms,
and threw herself sobbing at his feet. He made no attempt to console her or
raise her; to her despairing question as to what she could be seeking in the
Bancal house, since as a widow she was perfectly free to come and go as she
pleased and could dispense with secrecy, the President's reply was a significant
shrug; and so firmly was his sinister conjecture imbedded, that upon her
dignified demand for a just consideration, he only flung back the retort: &quot;Tell
the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The news was not slow to travel. Relatives and friends of the
President made their appearance: amazed, excited, eager, malicious. To see the
impenetrably peculiar, elusively unapproachable Clarissa cast into the mire was
a sight they were all anxious to enjoy. A few of the older ladies attempted a
hypocritically gentle persuasion, and Clarissa's contemptuous silence and the
pained look of her eyes seemed to imply avowals. The Prefect came once more,
accompanied by two officials. For the Government and the local functionaries
everything was at stake; the cry for revenge of the citizens, anxious for their
safety, the defiance and rancor of the Bonapartists, grew more violent every
day, the papers demanded the conviction of the guilty persons, the rural
population was on the point of a revolt. A witness who had no share in the deed
itself, like Madame Mirabel, could quickly change and terminate everything;
persuasion was brought to bear, she was promised, as far as the oath to which
she subscribed in the Bancal house was concerned, a written dispensation from
Rome, and a Jesuit priest whom the Mayor brought to the château expressly
confirmed this. When everything proved vain and Clarissa began to oppose the
cruel pressure by a stony calm, she was threatened with imprisonment, with
having her disgrace and depravity made public through all France. And at these
words of the Prefect her father fell upon his knees before her, as she had done
that morning before him, and conjured her to speak. This was too much; with a
shriek, she fell fainting to the floor.</p>

<p class="normal">Clarissa believed she remembered having spent the evening of
the nineteenth of March with the Pal family, in Rodez; she believed she
remembered that Madame Pal herself remarked to her the following day: &quot;We were
so merry yesterday, and perhaps at that very time poor Fualdes was being
murdered.&quot; Upon referring to this, the Pals made a positive denial of
everything; they denied that Clarissa had paid them a visit; nay, in their
vague, cowardly fright, they even declared that they had been on bad terms with
Madame Mirabel for years.</p>

<p class="normal">To human pity spirits blinded by fear and delusion were no
longer accessible. Even had the sound sense of a single individual attempted
resistance, it would have been useless; the giant avalanche could not be stayed.
A diabolical plot was concocted, and it was the Prefect, Count d'Estournel, who
perfected it in such wise that it promised the best success. Toward one o'clock
at night a carriage drove into the castle grounds; Clarissa was compelled to
enter it; the President, the Magistrate, the Prefect, were her companions. The
carriage stopped in front of the Bancal house. Monsieur Seguret led his daughter
into the ground floor room on the left, a cave-like chamber, gloomy as a bad
conscience. On the shelf over the stove there stood a miserable little lamp
whose light fell on two sheriff's officers and a lawyer's clerk, with stern
countenances, leaning against the wall. The windows were hung with rags, the
alcoves were pitchy dark, a mute silence reigned throughout the house.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know this place?&quot; asked the Prefect with solemn
deliberation. All turned their gaze upon Clarissa. In order to soften the
frightful tension of her breast, she listened to the rain, which was beating
against the wall outside; all her senses seemed to have gathered in her ear to
that end. Her body grew limp, her tongue refused to utter more than &quot;no&quot; or
&quot;yes,&quot; and since the first promised new torment and agony, but the latter
perchance peace, she breathed a &quot;yes:&quot; a little word, born of fear and
exhaustion, and, scarce alive, winged with a mysterious power. Her mind,
confused and consumed with longing, turned a phantom image, the creation of a
thousand effervescent brains, into an actual experience. The half consciously
heard, half distractedly read, became a burning reality. Her existence seemed
strangely entangled in that of the man of the wood and dale, who had fervently
lifted his head to heaven, and sniffed in the air with the expression of a
thirsting animal. Now she stood upon the bridge which led to his domain; she
beheld herself sitting at his feet, drops of blood from his outstretched hand
fell upon her bowed head. Consternation on the one hand, and the most radiant
hope on the other, seized her heart, while between there flamed like a torch,
there rang out exultant like a battle-cry, the name Bastide Grammont, a
plaything for her dreams.</p>

<p class="normal">An expression of relief flitted over the faces of the men upon
this first syllable of a significant confession. President Seguret covered his
eyes with his hand. He resolved in his heart to renounce his love for his
misguided child. Clarissa felt it; all the ties which had hitherto bound her
were broken.</p>

<p class="normal">She had, then, been in the room on the evening of the
nineteenth of March? she was asked. She nodded. How had she come there?
questioned Monsieur Jausion further, and his tone and mien were marked by a
certain cautiousness and nicety, as if he feared to disturb the still timorous
spirits of memory. Clarissa remained silent. Had she come by way of the Rue des
Hebdomadiers? asked the Prefect. Clarissa nodded. &quot;Speak! Speak!&quot; thundered
Monsieur Seguret suddenly, and even the two sheriff's officers were startled.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I met several persons,&quot; Clarissa whispered in a tone so low
that all involuntarily bent their heads forward. &quot;I was afraid of them, and I
ran, from fear, into the first open house.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Monsieur Jausion winked to the clerk. &quot;Into this house, then?&quot;
he asked in a caressing voice, while the clerk seated himself on the bench near
the stove and wrote in a crouching position.</p>

<p class="normal">Clarissa continued in the same plaintive whisper: &quot;I opened
the door of this room. Somebody seized me by the arm and led me into the alcove.
He enjoined me to be silent. It was Bastide Grammont.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At last the name! But how different it was to pronounce it
than merely to think it! Clarissa paused, while she closed her eyes and elapsed
her hands convulsively. &quot;After leaving me alone a while,&quot; she resumed as if
speaking in her sleep, &quot;he returned, bade me follow him and led me into the
street. There he stood still and asked whether I knew him. I first said yes,
then no. Thereupon he asked me if I had seen anything, and I said no. 'Go away!'
he ordered, and I went. But I had not reached the centre of the town when he was
again at my side and took my hand in his. 'I am not one of the murderers,' he
protested, 'I met you and my only object was to save you. Swear that you will
remain silent, swear on your father's life.' I swore, whereupon he left me. And
that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Monsieur Jausion smiled skeptically. &quot;You claim, Madame, to
have fled in here from the street,&quot; he remarked, &quot;but it has been established by
unexceptionable testimony that the gate was locked from eight o'clock on. How do
you explain that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Clarissa remained mute, even her breath seemed to stop. The
Prefect motioned to Monsieur Jausion to desist; for the present enough had been
attained, it was enough that Bastide Grammont had been recognized by Clarissa.
The resolve to force the criminal, who denied all share in the guilt, to a
confession by having him unexpectedly confront the witness, came as a matter of
course.</p>

<p class="normal">The gentlemen led Clarissa to the carriage, as she was
scarcely able to walk. At home she lapsed into a peculiar state. First she lay
back lethargically in a chair; suddenly she sprang up and cried: &quot;Take away the
murderers!&quot; The door opened and the terrified face of a servant appeared in the
crack. All the domestics stood waiting in the hall, most of them resolved to
leave the President's service. Clarissa saw herself deprived of all the
protection of love, and cast out from the circle where birth is respected and
binding forms are recognized as the least of duties. She was exposed to every
eye, the boldest gaze could pry into her inmost soul, she had become a public
object, nothing about her was any longer her own, she herself could no longer
find herself, find anything in herself upon which she could lean, she was
branded, without and within, food for the general prurience, tossed
defenselessly upon the filthy floods of gossip, the centre of a fearful
occurrence from which she could no more dissever her thoughts. Sadness, grief,
anxiety, scorn, these were no longer feelings for her, her blood coursed too
wildly for that; uncertainty of herself dominated her, doubts as to her
perception, doubts as to visible things in general; and now and then she would
prick her finger with a needle just to feel the pain, which would serve as
evidence of her being awake and might preserve her heart from decay. Added to
this, the torment she suffered from the intrusive: appeals to tell the truth,
the jeers from below, the command from above, the thirst for revenge and the
ineffaceableness of a word once spoken; lastly, she saw the whole world filled
with red tongues, ceaselessly chattering; bloody tongues with snakelike
movements, directed toward her; every object she touched turned into a slippery
tongue. Human countenances grew dim, save one, which, despite guilt and
condemnation, was enthroned, in heroic suffering, high above the others, nay,
appeared preeminent through his guilt as well as his defiance. And the day she
was told that she was to confront Bastide Grammont in order to accuse him, her
pulses beat in joyous measure again for the first time, and she arrayed herself
as if for a festival.</p>

<p class="normal">The meeting was to take place in the magistrate's office.
Besides Monsieur Jausion and his clerks, Counselor Pinaud, who had returned, was
present. Monsieur Jausion cast a malicious glance at him over his spectacles as
Clarissa Mirabel, decked in lace, rustled in, bowed smiling to the gentlemen,
and then swept her gaze with cheerful calmness over the inhospitable room. From
a frame in the centre of the wall the fat and ill-humored face of the King
looked down upon her, as ill-humored as if each one of his subjects were
especially repugnant to him. She forgot that it was only a picture that hung
before her and looked up with a coquettish pout.</p>

<p class="normal">The magistrate made a sign, a side-door was thrown open, and
Bastide Grammont, with hands chained together and with an officer of justice on
either side of him, walked in. Clarissa gave a low cry and her face turned
livid.</p>

<p class="normal">Prison atmosphere enveloped Bastide. The shaggy hair, the
long, neglected beard, the staring, somewhat dazed look, the slight stoop, as of
a carrier of burdens, of the gigantic form, the secretly quivering wrath upon
his newly furrowed brow&#8212;all proclaimed their cause and origin. Yes, he seemed to
carry about him the invisible walls which filled him with agony and gloom, and
which, month after month, pictured to him with more and more hopeless brilliance
the images of freedom, until finally they refused to delude him with blooming
tree or flourishing field; then they resembled the desolate gray of an autumn
evening, when the air already smacks of winter, the hearse rattles oftener than
usual past the garden-gate toward the little churchyard, and the rising
half-moon floats in glowing radiance in the misty azure like a bleeding, divided
heart.</p>

<p class="normal">And yet that haughty eye, in which shone the resolve to be
true to himself? And yet that strangely bitter scorn in his mien which might be
compared to the cautious and at the same time majestic crouching of a tiger cat?
The infinite contempt with which he looked at the hands of the clerks, prepared
to write, his inner freedom and grand detachment in spite of the handcuffs and
the two soldiers?</p>

<p class="normal">It was this that wrung the cry from Clarissa's lips, and drove
the mad merriment from her face. Not, indeed, because she was forced to behold
the former genius of the woods and wilds bound and shattered, but because she
recognized as in a flash of lightning that that hand could not have wielded a
murderous knife, that such a deed did not touch the circle of his being, even if
he may have been capable of the act, and that all was in vain, an
incomprehensible intoxication and madness, an impenetrable horror, an exhibition
of hypocrisy and disease, A dizziness seized her as if she were falling from a
high tower. She was ashamed of her showy dress, its conspicuous finery, and in
passionate excitement she tore the costly lace from her arms and, with an
expression of the utmost loathing, threw it on the ground.</p>

<p class="normal">Monsieur Jausion must have interpreted it differently. Again
he smiled at Monsieur Pinaud, but this time in triumph, as if he would say: the
sample tallies. &quot;Do you know this lady, Bastide Grammont?&quot; he asked the
prisoner. Bastide turned his head aside, and his look of careless, bitter
disdain cut Clarissa to the quick. &quot;I don't know her,&quot; he replied gloomily, &quot;I
have never seen her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And once more Monsieur Jausion smiled, as if to correct a
parsing error, and murmured: &quot;That is not possible; Madame Mirabel, dressed at
that time as a man, and with a hat with green feathers, was in the Bancal house,
and was led by you yourself to the street, where you received her oath. I beg
you to call it to mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Bastide's face contracted as if at the annoying persistence of
a fly, and he repeated in a loud, energetic tone: &quot;I don't know the lady. I have
never seen her.&quot; And his tightly compressed lips betrayed his firm resolve to
remain silent.</p>

<p class="normal">Monsieur Jausion adjusted his wig and looked troubled. &quot;What
answer have you to that, Madame?&quot; he asked, addressing Clarissa.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He may not know that I saw him,&quot; she said in a whisper, but
her voice had the penetrating quality of the chirping of a cricket.</p>

<p class="normal">Bastide turned toward her once more, and in the somewhat
oblique glance of his wearily brilliant eyes there was a mixture of curiosity
and scorn, no more, however, than would be bestowed upon a mushroom or a spider.
Inwardly he weighed, as it were, the slender, childlike form, wondered casually
at the agitation of her gestures, her flashing eyes, the helpless twitching of
her lips, wondered at the lace lying on the floor, and thought he was dreaming
when he became aware that an imploring gesture of her hands was meant for him.</p>

<p class="normal">The magistrate sprang up and, with distorted face, cried: &quot;Do
not jest with us, Madame, it may cost you dear. Speak out, then! A forced oath
is not valid! The peace of your fellow-citizens, the peace of the country is at
stake. Free yourself from the spell of the wretched being! Your infamous smile,
Grammont, will be laid to your account on the day of the sentence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Counselor Pinaud stepped forward and murmured a few words into
the ear of Bastide, who lifted his arms, and with an expression of consuming
rage pressed his clenched, chained hands to his eyes. Clarissa staggered to the
magistrate's table, and while a deadly pallor overspread her cheeks, she
shrieked: &quot;It is all a lie! Lie! Lie!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Monsieur Jausion measured her from head to foot. &quot;Then I place
you in the position of an accused person, Madame, and declare you under arrest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A gleam of mournful satisfaction flitted over Clarissa's
features. Swiftly, with the lightning-like wheeling of a dancer, she turned
toward Bastide Grammont, looked at him as one looks up at a stormy sky after a
sultry day, and with a pained, long-drawn breath, she called his name in a low
voice. He, however, stepped back as if at an impure touch, and never before had
Clarissa encountered such a glance and expression of disdain. Her knees shook, a
feeling of distress overcame her, her eyes filled with tears. It was only when
the door of the prison closed behind her that the helpless sensation of being
flogged left her. Shame and remorse overpowered her; even the mysteriousness of
her position afforded her but slight consolation. Controlled by no law, she
seemed to have been shoved off the track upon which, in the ordinary course of
nature, cause and effect, cumbrously linked together, crawl along in the slow
process of experience.</p>

<p class="normal">In accordance with her station, she had been assigned the best
room in the prison. The first hours she lay on the straw-bed and writhed in
agony. When the keeper on her urgent request brought a light, as she feared she
would go insane in the darkness, the candle-light fell upon the image of Christ
upon the cross with the crown of thorns, which hung upon the gray-tinted wall.
She gave a shriek, her overstrained senses found in the features of the Saviour
a resemblance to those of Bastide Grammont. His lips had had the same agonized
curve when he pressed his clenched hands to his eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">Once more she rebelled against the boundless injustice. To
live with the world was her real element; her entire nature was attuned to a
kindly understanding with people. She asked for paper and pen, and wrote a
letter to the Prefect.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Justice, Count!&quot; she wrote. &quot;It is still time to prevent the
worst. Remember the difficulty you had in extorting from me what was supposed to
be the truth, remember the threats which made me compliant. I am a victim of
circumstances. Whatever I confessed is false. No man of sense can discover the
stamp of probability in my statements. In a freak of desperation I bore false
witness. Tell my father that his cruelty is more sure to rob him of his daughter
than her seeming transgression. Already I know not what I should believe, the
past escapes my memory, my confidence begins to totter. If it is too much to ask
for justice, then I beg for mercy. My destiny seeks to try me, but my heart is
clear as the day.&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><a name="pix_40" href="#pixRef_40"><img src="images/bathing.png" alt="Bathing_Woman"></a></p>

<p class="normal">It was in vain. It was too late for words, even if the mouth
of a prophet had proclaimed them in tones of thunder. The next morning many of
the witnesses and prisoners were brought before Clarissa. Thus there were Bach,
the Bancals, the soldier Colard, Rose Feral, Missonier, and little Madeleine
Bancal. Bousquier was ill. The sight of the crushed, slouching, phantom-like
creatures, intimidated by a hundred torments, revengefully ready for any deed,
disturbed her to the core, and gave her at the same time a feeling of indelible
contamination. &quot;Is she the one?&quot; each of the unfortunates was asked&#8212;and with
insolent indifference they answered: &quot;It is she.&quot; Missonier alone stood there
laughing like an idiot.</p>

<p class="normal">Clarissa was amazed. She had not expected that the answers
would be characterized by such assurance, such a matter-of-fact air. With inward
sobs she held from her what was undeniable in the present situation, and
shudderingly sought a path in her memory to that past situation on which the
present was founded and which she was asked to verify. Her agitated spirit crept
back to her earlier years, back to her youth, to her childhood, in order to
discover her inimical second-self; that which had seemed weird and strange
gradually became the essence and centre of her being, and the fateful night in
Bancal's house turned, like the rest of the world, into a vision of blood and
wounds.</p>

<p class="normal">But athwart the gloomy fancies the way led to Bastide
Grammont; a flowery path among burning houses. It seemed fine to her to be
assured of his guilt. Perchance he had pressed his lips to hers before he had
clutched the murderous knife. She coupled her own obscurely felt guilt with his
greater one. That which cut him off from humanity bound him to her. His reasons
for the deed? She did not concern herself about them. No doubt it had struck
root when she had first beheld him, when he had swallowed in a breath all the
wood, all the springtime. No matter whether he dipped his hands in the sunlight
or in blood, both pertained to his image, to her mysterious passion, and Fualdes
was the evil genius and the destructive principle. &quot;Ah,&quot; she reflected in her
singular musing, &quot;had I known of it, I should have committed the deed myself and
might have been a heroine like Charlotte Corday!&quot; Why, however, did he deny it,
why was he silent? Why that look of overwhelming contempt, which she could not
forget and which still scorched her skin like a brand of infamy? Was he too
proud to bow to a sentence which put his crime on a level with that of any
highwayman? No doubt he did not recognize his judges. She could, then, draw him
down to herself, make him dependent upon the breath of her lips; and she forgot
the iron alternatives that confront one's destiny here, and let herself go like
a child that knows nothing of death.</p>

<p class="normal">The trial before the court of assizes was set for the
sixteenth of October. At noon of the tenth, Clarissa requested an interview with
Monsieur Jausion. Conducted before the magistrate, she declared she knew about
the whole matter, and wished to confess everything. In a voice trembling with
excitement. Monsieur Jausion summoned his clerks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I came into the room and saw the knife glisten,&quot; Clarissa
confessed. &quot;I took refuge in the alcove, Bastide Grammont hurried after me,
embraced and kissed me. He confided to me that Fualdes must die, for the old
devil had destroyed his happiness and made life worthless to him. Bastide was
intoxicated, as it were, with enthusiasm, and when I raised objections, he
stopped my mouth with kisses once more, yes, he kissed me so hard that I could
not offer any resistance. Then he had me take an oath, whereupon he left me and
I heard a groaning, I heard a terrible cry; little Madeleine Bancal, who was
lying in bed, raised herself suddenly and wept. Then I lost consciousness, and
when I regained it I found myself in the street.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She recounted this story in a mechanically measured tone; her
voice had a metallic ring, her eyes were veiled and half closed, her little
hands hung heavy at her side, and when she ceased she gazed before her with a
pleased smile.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You had consorted with Bastide Grammont before that, then?&quot;
questioned the Magistrate.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, we met in the forest. In the neighborhood of La Morne
there is an old well in the field; there, also, we used to meet frequently;
particularly at night and by moonlight. Once Bastide took me on his horse and we
rode at a furious pace to the gorge at Guignol. I asked, 'What are you fleeing
from, Bastide?' for I was cold with fright; and he whispered: 'From myself and
from the world.' Otherwise, however, he was always gentle. I have never known a
better man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">More and more silvery rang her voice, and finally she spoke
like one transported or asleep. Her statement was read aloud to her; she affixed
her signature calmly and without hesitation, whereupon Monsieur Jausion stated
to her that she was free.</p>

<p class="normal">In the château she was met by a hostile silence. The few
domestics who remained whispered insolently behind her back. Nobody looked to
her comfort, she had to fetch the pitcher of water herself from the kitchen. In
the meantime when President Seguret returned home, he already knew, as did the
whole town, about Clarissa's confession. The circumstance of her amorous
relation to Bastide shed a sudden light upon preceding events and wove a halo
about her former silence. But Monsieur Seguret only hardened his heart all the
more, and when he passed her as she stood on the threshold of her room, he
turned away his head with a gesture of disgust.</p>

<p class="normal">In the evening the President entertained a number of his
friends. In the course of the meal the door opened and Clarissa made her
appearance. Monsieur Seguret sprang from his chair, rage robbing him of speech.
&quot;Do not dare,&quot; he stammered hoarsely, &quot;do not dare!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Regardless of that, Clarissa advanced to the edge of the
table. A radiant, bewitching expression lit up her countenance. She turned her
full gaze upon her father, so that he dropped his glance as if dazzled. &quot;Do not
revile me, father,&quot; she said gently in a tone of captivating entreaty.</p>

<p class="normal">She turned to one of the guests with a commonplace question.
The gentleman addressed hesitated, seemed confounded, astonished, but was unable
to resist. Her features, pallid from the prison atmosphere, had acquired
something dreamily spiritual; the most ordinary word from her lips had a charm
of its own.</p>

<p class="normal">The conversation became general; the guests conquered, nay,
forgot, their secret amazement. Clarissa's wit and playful humor exercised a
great fascination. Along with them, there was a sensuously pungent air about her
which does not escape men, her gestures had something flattering, her eyes
glowed with a romantic fire. Disturbed, lending but a reluctant ear. Monsieur
Seguret could, nevertheless, not wholly evade the witchery which took his guests
captive. A power stronger than his resolve forced him to leniency; he took a
timid share in the conversation, in spite of the heavy load upon his heart. The
talk turned upon politics, books, art, hunting, the war, nothing and
everything&#8212;a sparkling interchange of polished phrases and sparkling
reflections, of smiles and plaudits, jest and earnest. At times it seemed like a
scene in a play enacted with masterly skill, or as if a light intoxication
induced by champagne had exhilarated their spirits; each one was at his best and
strove to outdo himself, and Clarissa held and led them all, like a fairy who
upon a chariot of clouds guides a flock of pigeons.</p>

<p class="normal">Shortly after midnight she rose, a fleeting, complacent,
capricious smile flashing across her face, and, with a rather affected bow, she
left the room, the men relapsing into a sudden, strange silence. Monsieur
Seguret was agitated when he conducted his guests to the door, and they left the
château as silently as thieves.</p>

<p class="normal">The President strode up and down the entrance-hall awhile, his
thoughts chasing each other like a fleeing troop of wild animals. As the echo of
his footsteps struck him unpleasantly, he stepped out into the garden, and,
strolling in the winding paths, he inhaled the fresh night air with a feeling of
relief. As lie was leaving the avenue of yews, a streak of light fell across the
path; Monsieur Seguret stepped upon the low wall encircling a small fountain and
could thus look into Clarissa's room, the windows of which stood open. With
difficulty he refrained from crying out in astonishment on beholding Clarissa in
a loose nightdress, dancing with an expression of ecstasy and with passionate
movements. Her eyes were tightly closed, as if they were sealed, her eyebrows
lifted in coquettish anxiety, her shoulders rocked in a stream of inaudible
tones whose tempo seemed now hurried, now excessively slow. Suddenly she seized
something and held it before her,&#8212;it was a mirror; glancing into it, she
recoiled with a shudder and let it fall, so that the listener could hear the
clinking of the broken glass; then she went up to the window, tore her dress
from her bosom, laid her hand upon her bare breast and looked straight in the
direction where Monsieur Seguret was standing. He crouched down as if a gun had
been aimed at him; Clarissa, however, did not see him; she fixed her gaze awhile
upon the sweeping clouds and then closed the window. The President remained
standing at his post some time longer and was unable to divert the current of
his thoughts. Whom is she deceiving? he pondered, distressed&#8212;herself, or people
in general, or God?</p>

<p class="normal">For the first time in many days Clarissa enjoyed a peaceful
sleep once more. Yet when she laid herself in her white bed the pillows seemed
to assume a purple hue and she fell into slumber as into an abyss. She dreamed
of landscapes, of weird old houses, and of a sky that looked like clotted blood.
She herself wandered in the silvery light, and without feeling any touch or
seeing any human form, she nevertheless had a sensation of passionate kisses
being pressed upon her lips, and there was a stirring in her body as of life
taking shape.</p>

<p class="normal">This strange mood and agitation endured for days afterward. A
silvery veil lay between her and the world. For fear of rending it, she spoke in
low tones and walked with measured steps; beyond it, the sun had no more
illuminating power than the moon. When, on the evening before the trial, she was
returning from a stroll in the fields, she saw two women standing in the gateway
of the château. One of them hurried forward to meet her, threw herself on her
knees and seized her hands. It was Charlotte Arlabosse. &quot;What have you done?&quot;
murmured the beautiful girl, panting. &quot;He is innocent, by Christ's Passion, he
is innocent! Have mercy, Madame, even if not upon me, at least upon his old
mother!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The crimson of the setting sun lit up her features, distorted
by grief. Behind Charlotte there stood a lady of portly build, with great warts
on her hands; yet her face was thin, and her countenance as motionless as that
of the dead. She resembled a tree exuberant in strength, whose crown is
blighted.</p>

<p class="normal">Clarissa made a deprecatory gesture, yet she retained a
friendly and calm air. A second later, she thought she beheld herself in the
kneeling figure, beheld her double; and a cruel triumph filled her heart. &quot;Have
no care, my child,&quot; said she, smiling, in a low voice; &quot;as far as Bastide is
concerned, everything is already settled.&quot; Thereupon she opened the gate and
walked into the house. Charlotte arose and gazed motionless through the grating.</p>

<p class="normal">That night Clarissa retired early, but she awoke at four
o'clock and began dressing. She selected a black velvet dress, and, as her only
ornament, she fastened a diamond star in the edge of it at her bare neck. Her
heart beat faster the nearer the hour approached. At eight o'clock the carriage
drew up; it was a long drive to Alby, where the Court of Assizes sat. Monsieur
Seguret had ridden away early in the morning, nobody knew whither.</p>

<p class="normal">The walls of the old town had hardly come in sight before such
a mass of people was to be seen on the road that the horses were obliged to
slacken their pace. They surrounded the carriage and gazed with strained
attention into the open windows; women lifted up their children that they, too,
might see the famous Madame Mirabel. She did not seek to escape the general
curiosity; with the happy smile of a bride she sat there, her fine black brows
lifted high on her forehead.</p>

<p class="normal">On the stroke of ten President Enjalran, who was to preside at
the trial, appeared in the overcrowded hall, and after the reading of the
lengthy indictment Bastide was summoned to the hearing.</p>

<p class="normal">Firm as if cast in bronze he stood before the judge's table.
His answers were cool, terse, and clear. From beginning to end he now saw
through the senseless fable, woven of stupidity and malice. By a biting sarcasm
he showed his unutterable contempt of all the accusations against him, thus
placing the counsel assigned to him at the last moment, with whom he stubbornly
refused to confer, in no slight embarrassment.</p>

<p class="normal">Now and then he turned his glance toward the tall, church-like
windows, and when he caught sight of a bird that had alighted on the sill and
dug his yellow bill into the feathers on his breast, he lost his self-command
for a moment and his lips parted in pain.</p>

<p class="normal">His examination lasted but a short time. It was only a matter
of form, for his fate was sealed. With Bach, Colard, and the other accomplices,
Monsieur d'Enjalran's task was easy; their testimony was petrified, as it were.
Bousquier had died in prison. Of the others, each one sought to grab at a little
remnant of innocence; they produced the impression of men crushed and wholly
bereft of will-power. A sensation was created by old Bancal, who became
hysterical during his examination, and then, protesting his innocence, behaved
like a madman. The humpbacked Missonier grinned when the question of his
presence at the murder was discussed; he had become brutalized by his long
imprisonment and the repeated examinations. Little Madeleine Bancal behaved like
an actress, and greeted her acquaintances and patrons in the audience by
throwing them kisses. Rose Feral turned deadly pale at the sight of the bloody
rags on the Judge's table, and could not utter a word. Madame Bancal remembered
that Monsieur Fualdes was dragged into her house by six men, that he was made to
sign a number of papers, crisscross, as she said. The day following, she had
found one of these bills, made out upon stamped paper, but as it was stained
with blood, had burned it. More than that she positively refused to confess, met
all questions with a stolid silence, and declared finally that whatever else she
knew she would confide to her confessor alone.</p>

<p class="normal">The witnesses testified placidly the most incredible things.
Their memory was so good that they recollected the hour and minute of the merest
trifles, which are forgotten from one day to the next. In night and fog they had
seen and recognized people, their features, their gestures, the color of their
clothes. They had heard speaking, whispering, sighing, through thick walls. A
beggar by the name of Laville, who used to sleep in Missonier's stable, had
heard not only the organ-grinders but also four men carrying a burden, something
like men dragging a barrel. Bastide Grammont laughed repeatedly at statements
which he declared to be shameless lies. When the Bancal woman began her
testimony he remarked that since it came so late he had expected that the old
woman would be delivered of it with still greater difficulty. To another witness
he represented, in a vibrating voice, how the hand of Heaven rested heavy upon
her, and reminded her of the awful death of her child. He was like a fencer
whose opponent is the mist; nobody, indeed, replied to him, he stood alone, the
contradictions which he believed he had demonstrated remained there, that was
all. At first he was self-confident and maintained his composure, looked firmly
into the witnesses' faces; then he felt as if his sense for the significance of
words were leaving him, not alone for his own but for that of all the words in
existence, or as if the ground were giving way under him and he were falling
irresistibly from space to space into an awful, infinite, boundless void. His
mind refused to work; he asked himself, horrified, whether this was still life,
dared call itself life; Nature's glorious structure seemed to him ravaged like a
wall rent by a storm, the speaking mouth of all these people struck him as
nothing but a chasm convulsively and repellently opening and shutting, darkness
invaded his spirit, he burned with a feeling of shame, he felt ashamed in the
name of the nameless God, ashamed that his body was molded like that of these
creatures around him. He had loved the world, had once loved the people in it;
now he was ashamed of them. It pained him to think that he had ever cherished
hopes, buoyed up his heart with promises, that sunshine and sky had ever been
able to lure from him a joyful glance, sportive words a smile; he wished he had,
like the stone by the wayside, never betrayed what he felt, so that he might not
have been doomed to bear witness before his own branded, scourged, unspeakably
humiliated self. Thought alone seemed offensive enough to him, how much more so
what he could have said; it was nothing, less than a breath. What could he
depend upon? what hope for? They had no faith, not even in his scorn, not even
in his silence. And Bastide locked himself up, and looked into the dawning
countenance of Death.</p>

<p class="normal">It was already growing dark when the King's evidence, Madame
Mirabel, was finally summoned to the court-room, and the whole tired assemblage
started up convulsively like a single body. She entered, and in spite of the
close air of the room, she seemed to be shivering. She trembled visibly on
taking the oath. Monsieur d'Enjalran urged her to testify in accordance with the
truth. In a strange, uniformly dull tone, yet speaking rather hurriedly, she
repeated the statement that she had made before the examining magistrate. An
oppressive silence pervaded the hall, and her voice, in consequence, grew
steadily lower. She knew now a multitude of details, had seen the long knife
lying on the table, had seen Bancal and Colard bring in a wooden tub, and the
lawyer Fualdes sitting with bowed shoulders near the lamp, writing. She had also
seen the mysterious stranger with the wooden leg, and noticed that Bach and
Bousquier unfolded a large white cloth. To the question why she had appeared in
men's clothes, she gave no reply. And when, with fingers convulsively clasped,
head bowed, her slender body bent slightly forward, writhing almost
imperceptibly, as if in the clutches of an animal, yet with that blissful, sweet
smile which lent her countenance an expression of subdued madness, she related
with bated breath how Bastide had embraced and kissed her in the dark adjoining
room, he sprang up suddenly, wrung his hands in despair and made a few hurried
steps until he stood at Clarissa's side. His heavy breathing was audible to all.</p>

<p class="normal">The presiding officer rebuked him for his behavior, which he
designated as indelicate, but Bastide cried in a firm, ringing voice: &quot;Before
God, who hears me and will judge me, I declare that it is all an awful lie. I
have never as much as touched that woman or set eyes upon her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Clarissa turned as white as chalk. It seemed to her as if she
had but just now heard the clinking of the shattered mirror which she had dashed
to the floor after the dance. When the prosecuting attorney asked her to
continue, she remained silent; her eyes rolled and her whole body shook
convulsively.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Speak out!&quot; exclaimed Bastide, addressing her, and
indignation almost choked his voice, &quot;speak! Your silence is even more ruinous
to me than all the lies.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Clarissa lifted her eyes to him and asked with curious
emotion: &quot;Do you really not know me, Bastide?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No! no! no!&quot; he burst out, and looking upward he muttered in
distress: &quot;She is demented.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Within a second's space Clarissa grew fiery red and again
deathly pale. And turning toward Bastide once more, she exclaimed in a terrible
tone of reproach: &quot;Oh, murderer!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The public applauded. Clarissa reeled, however; an usher of
the court hurried to her side and caught her in his arms, a number of ladies
left their places and busied themselves about her, and half an hour elapsed
before she regained consciousness; but her appearance was as changed as if she
had suddenly aged by twenty years. Monsieur d'Enjalran tried to continue the
examination, but she answered only in incoherent words; she did not know; it was
possible; she did not wish to contradict. Bastide Grammont had resumed his seat
in the prisoner's dock; immeasurable distress and consternation were pictured on
his countenance. His counsel bade Clarissa, since she had spoken, to continue.
&quot;I adjure you, Madame, make yourself clear,&quot; he said; &quot;it depends upon you
whether an innocent man shall be saved or shall be sent to the scaffold.&quot;
Clarissa remained silent, as if she had not heard; in her breast there surged,
like morning mist over the waters, a consoling and captivating image. Counselor
Pinaud now turned to her with a severe exhortation; she was not to think she
could make her assertions at will and suppress what she wished. The prosecuting
attorney spoke up for her, saying that the cause of her silence was known; she
herself had asserted that she entertained a conviction the grounds of which she
could not state; it should suffice that she had uttered what was of the greatest
importance; nay, he declared, moreover, that any further urging would be
improper. He had not concluded his speech when Clarissa interrupted him; raising
her right arm she said in solemn protest: &quot;I have taken no oath.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Bastide Grammont looked up. Shaking off his stupor, he raised
himself slowly and began in a voice all the more affecting by its calmness:
&quot;Prison walls do not speak. And yet the time will come when they will find a
voice and will proclaim the secret means which have been employed to force all
these wretches to make lies a shameful bulwark of their lives. Fualdes was not
my enemy, he was only my creditor. If covetousness had misled a man otherwise
decent and moderate, if it had armed his hand, I would never, for all that, have
raised it against a defenseless old man. If you want a sacrifice, take me; I am
ready, but do not mingle my lot with that of this brood. My family, who have
always dwelt in the country, and have followed the customs and simple ways of
rural life, are disgraced. My mother weeps and is crushed. Judge whether I, who
am plunged in this sea of misfortune, can still cherish a love of life. I loved
freedom once, I loved animals, the water, the sky, the air, and the fruits of
the trees; but now I am dishonored, and if there were a future before me it
would be sullied with shame, and the time would have an ill taste. Is it a court
of justice before which I have been summoned? No, it is a hunt, the judge has
become a hunter and prepares the innocent one to be a tidbit for the rabble. I
ask no longer for justice, it is too late to mete out justice to me, too late,
were the crown of France itself to be offered to me. I surrender myself to you
to destroy me, your conscience will be loaded with that burden. One guilty man
makes many, and your children's children will for this flood the living world
with disgrace.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A paralyzed silence succeeded these words. But suddenly there
burst forth an indescribable tumult. The public and the jurors arose and
clenched their fists at Bastide Grammont, screamed and howled in wild confusion,
Monsieur d'Enjalran's exhortation dying away unheard. And just as suddenly a
deathly silence ensued. A faint, long-drawn cry which arose in the din, and now
continued its plaintive note, petrified the faces of the listeners. All eyes
tourned toward Clarissa. She felt the glances showering down upon her like the
beams in a falling building.</p>

<p class="normal">Her heart was aflame with a desire for expiation ...</p>

<p class="normal">The speech of the public prosecutor gathered together once
more the weapons of hatred which Rumor had forged against its victims; with
cunning skill, he painted the night of the murder in such colors that the horror
of it seemed to live for the first time, Bastide's advocate, on the other hand,
contented himself with high-sounding phrases; he waxed warm, his listeners
remained cold. While he was speaking there was a shoving and pushing in the rear
of the hall; some of the ladies shrieked, a fair-sized dog ran through an
opening in the bar, looked around him with glistening eyes, and, giving a short
bark, crouched at Bastide's feet. Deeply moved, he laid his hand on the animal's
neck, and motioned the usher, who wanted to remove it, back with a commanding
gesture.</p>

<p class="normal">When the court retired for consultation, no one dared speak
above a whisper. A woman sobbed and she was told to be quiet; it was the Benoit
girl, Colard's sweetheart. She had wound her arms about the poor wretch's
shoulders and her tear-stained face expressed but one desire&#8212;to share his fate.
A relative of Bastide approached him in order to speak to him; Bastide shook his
head and did not even look at the man. A sort of drowsiness had settled on his
countenance&#8212;at any rate, words no longer carried any weight in his ears. Yet it
happened that he lifted his eyes once more and after coursing through
illimitable space they met those of Clarissa. Now the strange woman did not
strike him as so strange. He heard, again the sound of her voice when she called
him murderer; was it not rather a cry for help than an accusation? and that
beseeching look, as if invisible hands were clutching at her throat? and that
most delicate form so singularly free from indications of her age, quivering
like a young birch in autumn?</p>

<p class="normal">Two lonely shipwrecked beings are driven by the currents of
the ocean to the same spot, coming from opposite ends of the earth, unable to
abandon the plank upon which their life depends, unable even to grasp each
other's hands simply driven by the gradually dying wind to unknown depths. There
was something weird in their mutual feeling of compassion. Yet Bastide's pained
and gloomy astonishment gave way to the dreamy intoxication of fatigue, and the
watchful eyes of his dog appeared to him like two reddish stars between black
tree-tops. He heard the sentence of death when the court returned; he had risen,
and listened to the words of the presiding judge; it sounded like the splashing
of raindrops on withered leaves. He heard himself say something, but what it was
he hardly knew. He saw many faces turned toward him in the dim light, and they
gave him the impression of worm-eaten and decaying apples.</p>

<p class="normal">The verdict concerning the other accused persons was not to be
announced until the following day. The crowds in the hall, in the entrances, and
on the street, dispersed slowly. When Clarissa passed through the corridor every
one stepped timidly aside.</p>

<p class="normal">She had learned that Bastide was not to be taken back to
Rodez, but was to remain in the prison at Alby. She thereupon dismissed the
carriage that was waiting for her, betook herself to an inn near by, where she
asked for a room, and wrote a letter to her father&#8212;a few feverishly agitated
sentences: &quot;I know no longer what is truth and what is falsehood; Bastide is
innocent, and I have destroyed him, though my desire was to help him; Yes and No
are in my breast like two extinguished flames; if I were to return whence I came
I should suffer a continual death; for that reason and because people live as
they do, I go where I must.&quot; It was already past midnight when she asked to
speak to the host. She requested him to send the letter in the morning to
Château Perrié by a reliable messenger; she then asked the startled man to sell
her a small basket of fresh fruit. The host expressed a polite regret that he
had nothing more in his storeroom. Passionately urgent, she offered him ten,
twentyfold its value and threw a gold piece on the table. &quot;It is for a dying
person,&quot; she said, &quot;everything depends upon it.&quot; The man gazed anxiously at the
pallid, gleaming countenance of the distinguished looking woman and pondered,
declaring finally that he would rouse his neighbor, and bidding her wait. Left
alone, she knelt down by the bedside, buried her face in the pillows and wept.
After half an hour the host returned, carrying a basket full of pears, grapes,
pomegranates, and peaches. Shaking his head, he followed her with his eyes as
she hastened away, and held the sealed letter, which he was to forward,
inquisitively up to the light.</p>

<p class="normal">The streets were desolate and bathed in shadowy moonlight. The
windows of the little houses were blinking drowsily; under a gateway stood the
night-watchman with a halberd and mumbled like a drunken man. In front of the
low prison building there was an open space; Clarissa seated herself on a stone
bench, and, as there was a pump near by and she felt thirsty, drank her fill.
The softly swelling outlines of the hills melted almost imperceptibly into the
sky, and behind a depression in the landscape a fire-light was glowing; she
seemed to hear, too, on listening intently, the ringing of bells. The whole
world was not asleep, then, and she could link her anxious heart to human
concerns once more. After a time she rose, stepped over to the building, set the
basket of fruit on the ground, and knocked with the knocker at the gate. It was
a long while before the door-keeper appeared and gruffly demanded what she
wanted. &quot;I must speak to Bastide Grammont,&quot; she declared. The man made a face as
if a demented person had waylaid him, growled in a threatening tone and was
about to bang the door in her face. Clarissa clutched his arm with one hand, and
tore the diamond brooch from her breast with the other. &quot;There, there, there!&quot;
she stammered. The old man raised his lantern and examined the sparkling jeweled
ornament on all sides. Clarissa misinterpreted his grinning, anxious joy,
thought he was not satisfied, and gave him her purse into the bargain, &quot;What is
in the basket?&quot; he inquired respectfully but suspiciously. She showed him what
it contained. He contented himself with that, thought she was most likely the
mistress of the condemned man, and, upon locking the door, walked on in front of
her. They descended a few steps, then crossed a narrow passage. &quot;How long do you
wish to stay inside?&quot; asked the keeper, when they had reached an iron door.
Clarissa drew a deep breath and replied in a whisper that she would give three
knocks on the door. The old man nodded, said he would wait at the head of the
stairs, opened the door cautiously, handed the woman his lantern and locked the
door behind her.</p>

<p class="normal">Inside Clarissa clung to the wall to give her riotous pulses
time to subside. The room seemed moderately large and not altogether
uninhabitable. Bastide lay on a pallet along the opposite wall, asleep and fully
dressed. &quot;What a stillness!&quot; thought Clarissa shuddering, and stole softly to
the bedside of the sleeping man. What quiet in that countenance, too, what a
beautiful slumber, thought she, and her lips parted in mute sorrow. She placed
the lantern on the floor where its light would strike his face, then she knelt
down and listened to his steady breathing. Bastide's mouth was firmly closed,
his eyelids were motionless, a sign of dreamlessness; his long beard encircled
cheeks and chin like brown brushwood, his head was thrown slightly backward, and
his hair shone with a moist gleam. Gradually the peace of his countenance passed
into Clarissa too; all words, all signs which she had brought with her vanished,
she determined to do nothing more than place her gift by his bed and depart.
Accordingly she emptied the basket, and started and paused every time she heard
but a grain of sand crunch under her feet. When she had laid out all the fruit
and passed her hand tenderly over each, she grew more and more peaceful and
calm; she felt herself so strangely bound to death that she dismissed the
thought of leaving this room with a feeling akin to fear, and prepared to do
what possessed her so strongly, with a composed assurance. A desire to kiss him
arose within her, and she actually bent down toward him, but a commanding awe
arrested her, more even than the fear that he might awake. Her body twisted and
turned, she embraced him in spirit and felt as if she were freed from the earth,
like a pearl dropped from a ring. She then rose quietly, walked softly to the
other side of the room, stretched herself on the floor, took a small penknife
and opened the veins in both wrists by deep cuts. Within a quarter of an hour
she sighed twice, and the hand of Death sought in vain to wipe the enraptured
smile from her pallid lips.</p>

<p class="normal">Bastide still slept on, that abysmal sleep where total
oblivion chains and numbs body and spirit. Then he began to dream. He found
himself in a spacious, secluded chamber, the centre of which was occupied by a
richly decked table. Many people were seated around it; they were carousing and
having a merry time. Suddenly all eyes were turned to the middle of the table,
where a vessel of opaque blue glass, which had not been there before, now stood.
What was in the glass receptacle? what could it signify? who brought it? was
asked in muffled tones. Thereupon an uncanny silence ensued; all gazed now at
the blue vessel, now, with sullen suspicion, at each other. All at once, the
jovial revelers of a few moments ago arose and one accused the other of having
placed the covered dish on the table. A violent clamor now arose, some drew
their poniards, others swung chairs about, and meanwhile a slim, nude girl's
figure was seen to emerge, like white smoke, from the vessel on the table.
Bastide knew the face, it was that of the false witness Clarissa; with
snake-like glistening eyes she gazed at him, always only at him. All the men
followed her glance and they hurled themselves upon him. &quot;You must die! You must
die!&quot; resounded from hoarse throats, but while they were still shouting their
voices died away, the shadowy arms of the false witness stretched themselves out
and divided one of the walls, exposing to view a blooming garden, in the centre
of which stood a scaffold hung with branches laden with ripe fruit. Bastide was
a boy once more; slowly he strode out, Clarissa's hands waved above him and
plucked the fruit, and his fear of death was dulled by their intoxicating
perfume, which, like a cloud, filled the entire hall, nay, the entire universe.</p>

<p class="normal">Here he awoke. His first drowsy glance fell upon the
flickering light of the lantern, the second upon a huge pear, which, yellow as a
rising moon, lay at his bedside. In dazed, joyous astonishment he grasped it,
but on raising it to his lips noticed that it was stained with blood. He was
startled, thought he was still dreaming. Beyond the windows the gray light of
dawn was already spreading. Now he caught sight of the other fruit, gorgeous and
abundant, as if paradise had been pillaged. But all was stained with blood ... A
little rivulet of blood, divided into two streams, trickled over from the corner
of the wall.</p>

<p class="normal">And Bastide saw ...</p>

<p class="normal">He tried to rise, but his unfinished sleep still paralyzed his
body.</p>

<p class="normal">Bitter and wild grief wrung his breast. He longed no more for
the day which awoke so drearily outside; weary of his own heart-beats and
perfectly sure of what had happened and must happen, he yearned for the final
end. He desired no special knowledge of the consummated fate of the being on the
other side of the cell, who, dominated by mysterious spirits, had trust herself
into his path&#8212;no knowledge of men and what they built or destroyed. Man was an
abomination to him.</p>

<p class="normal">And yet when his glance fell upon the splendid fruit once
more, he felt the woe of all creation; he wished at least to close the eyes of
the giver. But just then the keeper, grown suspicious, turned the key in the
lock.</p>

<p class="normal">Before dawn the lawyer rose from his bed, and at that very
moment a thousand little birds, who lived in his room, began to twitter and
trill. &quot;Awake so early, little ones!&quot; whispered the lawyer. He never spoke
aloud.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, good morning! Hush! Hush!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And the thousand little birds chirped in answer and then
obediently stopped singing.</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer wrapped a thick woolen shawl around his shoulders,
for he was always very cold, slipped his feet into his wadded boots, drew on his
gloves, put his fur cap on his bald head and went out of the house.</p>

<p class="normal">It was still night and everything looked unreal and magical.
Now and then the grass would bow down with a sudden jerk, as people do in their
sleep, if they dream that they are falling, and then for a moment the lawyer
would feel a warm breath, which vanished as suddenly as it came. A confused mass
of gray and black clouds swept rapidly across the sky and at the zenith three
golden stars were visible in a line, so that they looked like a flying spear
darting through the clouds. The lawyer gazed thoughtfully for some moments at
the flying spear while his mind struggled with some dim idea. Then he hurried
with short shuffling steps as quietly as possible along the sandy paths of the
asylum gardens.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hush, keep still!&quot; he whispered, as he passed some bushes in
which something was stirring.</p>

<p class="normal">At the edge of the kitchen-garden there was an old well with a
pump which was no longer used, and here the lawyer began his task. He put the
watering-pot under the spout and began to pump, trying to make no noise. As
there was but little water in the well and the lawyer pumped slowly and
cautiously, it took him half an hour to fill the pot. Then, panting and
coughing, the little man carried it to the garden beds, and began to water the
flowers, smiling happily and speaking lovingly to them meanwhile. &quot;Don't be in
such a hurry, little ones,&quot; he whispered, &quot;my dear children, how you drink! Good
morning!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But just then began a great fluttering and stirring in an
elder bush. Hundreds of little birds suddenly thrust their heads out between the
leaves and chirped to the lawyer.</p>

<p class="normal">He made a startled gesture. &quot;For heaven's sake, be quiet!&quot;
said he. &quot;You are always trying to be the first! Every morning. Hush!&quot; And
immediately silence reigned in the elder bush.</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer went quietly from bed to bed and watered his
flowers. He stopped frequently to draw a deep breath and gazed up at the sky,
where the motionless golden spear still seemed to be darting through the clouds.
He pondered for some time over that and shook his head. From the &quot;violent ward&quot;
came a longdrawn wailing, which at regular intervals was merged in pitiful
weeping. But the lawyer paid no attention to these sounds. He only heard the
birds fluttering their wings and whetting their beaks in the bushes.</p>

<p class="normal">A night nurse passed by, shivering.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Already at work, so early?&quot; said she, turning her pale face
toward him.</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer put down his watering-pot, bowed and took off his
cap. &quot;One must keep at it,&quot; he whispered, &quot;the little ones will not wait.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he began with the tenderest care to water the beds beside
the principal buildings. He paused by the open windows of the kitchen, which
were very low, and examined the window-sills. He shook his head and seemed much
grieved and disappointed. Yes, they had once more forgotten to put out the bread
crumbs for his birds! How could any one rely upon such maids?</p>

<p class="normal">He hunted up a couple of little pebbles on the path and threw
them, one at a time, into the dark kitchen, laughing softly to himself. They
really must learn to be more careful. O, he would soon teach them to put the
bread crumbs regularly on the window-sill. There was plenty of gravel on the
path. And what if they had already complained so often!</p>

<p class="normal">The watering-pot was empty and in the gray light of dawn the
lawyer walked back to the well.</p>

<p class="normal">Ever since his wife's death the poor man had been a friend of
birds and flowers. When she was dying, she had said, with her last breath, &quot;The
flowers must always be watered and the birds must always be fed.&quot; Those had been
her last words and the lawyer heard them ringing in his ears day and night. He
heard them in every breeze, in every conversation, even when all was silent they
were wafted to him. In his wife's room there had stood a dark, heavy clothes
press (which, oddly enough, he could still remember), and this large, dark
object also repeated his wife's last words, although it made no sound whatever.
The lawyer continued to live in seclusion and solitude, and watered the flowers
in the window-boxes and fed and watered the birds in the cages. The flowers
withered and the birds died, one by one. The lawyer took no notice of his loss.
Indeed it seemed to him as if the birds were hopping and twittering gaily in
their cages. They hatched their young and kept on increasing. And the lawyer
took a childlike pleasure in this increase. Finally there were hundreds,
thousands, whose chirping he heard from morning till night. They lived in the
walls, on the ceiling, everywhere. And the good man could not understand why
others neither saw nor heard them.</p>

<p class="normal">As the sun rose, the lawyer had already finished a good part
of his day's work and turned back to the ward, which looked like a country
cottage standing in a pretty garden.</p>

<p class="normal">In the doorway, leaning against the doorpost, Michael Petroff,
a former officer in the Russian army, stood smiling, and greeted him with a
bright, cheerful &quot;Good morning, my friend!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer in his woolen shawl, scarf and wadded boots, bowed
and touched his cap.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good morning, Captain!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They bowed several times, for they respected each other
highly, and shook hands only after the completion of this ceremony.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you sleep well, Herr Advokat?&quot; asked Michael Petroff,
bending forward a little and smiling pleasantly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did I sleep well? Yes, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I too passed an excellent night,&quot; Michael Petroff continued
with a bright happy laugh. &quot;Really excellent. I had a dream&#8212;,&quot; he added, smiling
and gazing out into the garden with his right eye half closed. &quot;Yes, indeed!&#8212;Now
do come into my office, my friend. I have news. After you!&quot; He laid his hand on
the little lawyer's shoulder and with a slight bow allowed him to pass in first.</p>

<p class="normal">Captain Michael Petroff was a tall slender man with cheerful
steel-blue eyes and a small blond mustache, which like his soft, blond, parted
hair, was beginning to turn white. He was dressed with scrupulous neatness and
was carefully shaved. His chin was round and exquisitely formed, though a trifle
weak, the modeling of his mouth was unusually fine and delicate, like that of a
mere boy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Please be seated,&quot; said Michael Petroff, while with a gesture
he invited the lawyer to sit on the sofa.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But perhaps I am intruding?&quot; whispered the lawyer, and
remained standing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, indeed! How could you&#8212;?&quot; And Michael Petroff led the
lawyer over to the sofa. The little man sat down timidly, looking gratefully up
at his host. &quot;You are so very busy&#8212;I know&#8212;,&quot; said he, and nodded at the writing
table, which was heaped with documents, newspapers, and manuscripts.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have plenty to do,&quot; added Michael Petroff, with a curious
smile on his pretty boyish lips. &quot;But one has always time for one's friends.
Here, do listen! I have just outlined a petition to the Hessian government&#8212;,&quot;
Michael Petroff smiled and balanced a sheet of paper on his hand&#8212;&quot;The Hessian
government is to be urgently requested, most&#8212;urgently&#8212;requested, to reconsider
the verdict in the case of a teacher!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff glanced at his guest while four deep lines
suddenly appeared on his forehead. &quot;This teacher,&quot; he went on, &quot;was sentenced to
four years' imprisonment, only think&#8212;four years. He had ten mouths to feed and
he embezzled some funds. Voilà tout! What do you think of that! Ha, ha! That is
the way of the world, you see! In my petition I demand not merely that the
sentence should be revoked, but also that officers' salaries should be
increased. I demand it&#8212;I, Captain Michael Petroff, and I shall also appear in
the <i>Non-Partisan</i>. You will see, my friend!&quot; Michael Petroff cast a
fearless, triumphant glance at the little baldheaded lawyer, who listened and
nodded, although he did not quite understand what the Captain meant.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do a great deal of good!&quot; he whispered, nodding, while a
childish smile flitted over his sad, pale little face. And after a moment's
reflection he added, &quot;You are a good man. You surely are!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff shook his head. &quot;I do my duty!&quot; he declared
earnestly. And laying his hand on his heart while his clear steel-blue eyes
flashed, he added: &quot;My sacred duty!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Captain Michael Petroff, former officer in a St. Petersburg
regiment, considered it his life work to plead for justice in this world. He
called himself &quot;The Tribunal of right and justice.&quot; He subscribed for two large
daily papers, and searched them every day for cases in which, according to his
judgment, injustice had been done to some one. And every day Michael Petroff
found cases. Cases and nothing but cases. These cases he cut out, arranged them
in chronological order and immediately went to work on them.</p>

<p class="normal">He often sat up late in his office, as he called his room, or
in his editorial sanctum, as he sometimes designated it in an undertone when
speaking to his confidential friend. There he would sit and write, in a hand as
neat as copperplate, his memorials, protests, petitions, which he delivered
every day at six o'clock to the head physician. Dr. März. who had undertaken to
forward them regularly. Dr. März was glad to receive these manuscripts which he
laid in a separate pigeonhole, in order to use them from time to time as
material for his work on Graphomania.</p>

<p class="normal">The little time that this activity left him, Michael Petroff
employed in editing his newspaper. And it was because of this paper that he
sometimes secretly referred to his room as &quot;his editorial sanctum.&quot; This
newspaper did not appear regularly, but only when it happened to be ready. It
usually appeared once a year, but sometimes twice, if his nervous condition
urged him to greater haste.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff's paper was a fairly accurate representation
of an ordinary daily paper, from the heading, in which the conditions of
subscription were stated, as well as the name of the city in which the paper
appeared&#8212;the city was arbitrarily chosen by Michael Petroff&#8212;to the fictitious
names of the publisher and editor. Like any other paper, it contained
advertisements, which Michael Petroff simply cut out of other papers, a leading
article, and contributions. The whole editorial part, however, was engaged&#8212;with
the exception of a few articles which were slipped in as a disguise&#8212;with the
question: Is the confinement of Michael Petroff, Captain in the Russian army,
justified? The titles of the separate articles varied from year to year,
although the ideas expressed in them were similar. The Russian government's
Ultimatum!&#8212;A letter from the Czar to the head physician, Dr. März! And every
year the paper appeared under a different name. Michael Petroff called it <i>The
Eye of the World, The Conscience of Europe, The Bayonet.</i></p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff made no secret of his petitions, but he spoke
of his newspaper only to his confidant, the lawyer. And although he was
naturally friendly and very kind-hearted, possibly the reason he was so
extremely fond of the lawyer was that he could talk to him about his paper.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Just a moment, my friend,&quot; said he. &quot;There is such news! I
want to tell you the very latest. Please stay.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He went to the door and cleared his throat and listened. Then
he stepped out into the corridor, coughed, looked up and down and came back
satisfied. He drew out the editorial drawer, the key of which he wore around his
neck, and with a happy laugh began: &quot;The very latest! Listen! This cannot fail
to have its effect. Just hear the headline: Doctor März arrested!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Dr. März arrested?&quot; whispered the lawyer anxiously, looking
up at Petroff in open-mouthed astonishment.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff laughed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Arrested? No, of course not. I go on to explain in the
article that Dr. März is going to be arrested, and that the only way for him to
escape arrest is to give Michael Petroff his discharge immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer nodded. &quot;I see,&quot; said he, smiling because he saw
Petroff looking so cheerful. And yet he was not thinking anything about
Petroff's article, but only that he must give the birds their water. He grew
restless and started to rise.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Just a moment, please!&quot; said Michael Petroff eagerly. &quot;Yes,
it is really an excellent idea,&quot; he continued rapidly, while his cheeks flushed
with joy. &quot;In my article I emphasize the fact that Dr. März is an honorable man
and a highly prized and respected physician, so that his conduct in this
particular case causes widespread astonishment. I should like to ask you, my
friend, what he will do when he reads this article? Ha, ha, ha! They will find
out something, my dear fellow. I am not going to be unkind to him, not in the
least. Well, in fact, in fact, I shall say, my dear Doctor, ha, ha! But just
look at this too, in the <i>Non-Partisan</i>. Only look at this title, will you
please!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which one&#8212;?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, this one!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;An interrogation point?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes! Ha, ha&#8212;Simply an interrogation point! And beneath that:
Where is Michael Petroff? An appeal to the public! But look at this, in the
little <i>Feuilleton</i>: Michael Petroff, a Captain in the Russian army, has
just completed his six-volume work on Shooting Stars. All the scientific
journals are praising the clearness and acumen of this epoch-making work. Ha,
ha, ha, didn't I tell you that there was news, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer crouched in the sofa corner and made such an effort
to think, that he held his breath.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't understand&#8212;?&quot; he whispered and slowly shook his head.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What don't you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That he should keep you in confinement.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff glanced at the lawyer in surprise. Then he
leaned forward and whispered: &quot;But I have already told you that my relations pay
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They pay him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, of course!&quot; answered Michael Petroff cheerfully.
&quot;Enormous sums. Millions!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh!&quot; The lawyer began to understand now.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, you see, that is how it is in the world!&quot; said Michael
Petroff, and snapped his fingers.</p>

<p class="normal">But the lawyer did not wholly comprehend yet.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not understand,&quot; he began again. &quot;Dr. März is so
kindhearted. I live here, I have my home and my food and I pay nothing. He has
never asked me for any money.&#8212;I have no money, you know,&quot; he ended anxiously in
a still lower tone.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff laid his hand pompously but protectingly on
his friend's shoulder. &quot;You work in the garden,&quot; said he, &quot;you water the
flowers. How could he have the face to expect you to pay money? That is
perfectly simple. But perhaps you too have relations outside who pay for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Relations?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. Outside&#8212;there!&quot; A bitter smile curved Michael Petroff's
beautiful boyish mouth. Should he tell this little old man in the woolen shawl
where he really was? Should he perhaps explain to this little old man with the
grayish wrinkled face, that there was an &quot;outside&quot;&#8212;where one could even get into
a railway train or wash one's hands before sitting down to table? Suddenly he
stood up on his tiptoes and instantly lost all conception of his own actual
body; he seemed to himself like a gigantic tower rising up to the clouds, and
looking down on the little baldheaded man, who had only two thin tufts of gray
hair above his ears. He was seized with the desire to make the lawyer cry.</p>

<p class="normal">But suddenly he bowed slightly to his friend and said: &quot;Please
forgive Michael Petroff!&quot; He walked across the room, then turned to his guest
and said in precisely his usual tone: &quot;Will the fair weather last today?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think so&#8212;I am not sure,&quot; answered the lawyer doubtfully.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, we will play cricket this afternoon. Are you cold?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered the lawyer and drew his scarf closer.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff gazed at him with his head on one side. &quot;I
cannot understand how you can be cold today.&quot; And he laughed gaily. &quot;Come,&quot; said
he, &quot;let us&#8212;&quot; he paused, for he did not know what he wanted to do&#8212;&quot;Let us&#8212;Oh
yes, let us go and see Friend Engelhardt. Come!&#8212;The Doctor was with him last
night,&quot; he ended mysteriously.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The Doctor?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. Our friend is ill. Hm, hm.&quot; Michael Petroff carefully
locked up the manuscript of his newspaper, put on a big gray English traveling
cap, looked in the glass, and they left the room together. Michael Petroff
laughed a soft guttural laugh. At Engelhardt's door they paused to listen, and
then knocked.&#8212;</p>

<p class="normal">There were two great days in the year for Michael Petroff.</p>

<p class="normal">One was his birthday, the sixteenth of May. Michael Petroff
never forgot it. On May sixteenth he would walk about with an important air, and
looking about him he would say to every one he met: &quot;This is my birthday. I
thank you for your good wishes!&quot; The attendant always came before dinner and
asked him to come to Dr. März's room to receive his congratulations.</p>

<p class="normal">Then Michael Petroff would go, with quick, light steps to Dr.
März's parlor, shake hands with him and thank him for the wonderful bouquet of
white roses that Dr. März gave him.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael never suspected where the bunch of white roses came
from. He did not know that, on his birthday, his wife and daughter stood behind
the portiere of the parlor, nor that they made the long journey every year to
see him. The first few years the Captain's wife had had golden hair, but it had
gradually turned gray, and now it was white, although she was still quite a
young woman. Formerly she used to come alone, but for three years past she had
always been accompanied by a young lady, who wept bitterly when she arrived and
when she went away. This young lady had but one ear and concealed the
disfigurement by the way in which she dressed her hair. Michael Petroff had cut
off her other ear when she was only a child, during the first outbreak of his
malady.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff chatted and laughed pleasantly with the head
physician and carried the roses to his friend, the lawyer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here are some flowers for you. I do not want them!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer's eyes opened wide with delight, and he took the
roses carefully as if they were fragile.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff's second great day was that on which his
newspaper appeared.</p>

<p class="normal">The paper was always printed in the town. Michael Petroff had
induced the porter of the Sanatorium to undertake take this commission. The
porter delivered the manuscript to the printer and brought back the twenty-five
printed copies to Michael Petroff. And then for a few days he was in a state of
the greatest excitement. He sent the paper to the doctors, especially to Dr.
März, and waited in suspense to see what effect it would have. At such times he
could not work, but wandered about the house and garden all day. If he met a
doctor, he would stop and cast a triumphant glance at him, smiling as if secure
of victory.</p>

<p class="normal">But a few days later he would question the doctors: &quot;May I ask
whether you have received a newspaper?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A newspaper?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes! I received it myself. <i>The Bayonet</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh yes, I remember now. I will take a look at it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, please do. There may be some things in it that will
interest you. Ha, ha, ha!&quot; And he laid his hand on the Doctor's shoulder and
gazed meaningly at him.</p>

<p class="normal">Finally he asked the head physician himself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; answered he, &quot;certainly I read that paper, my dear
Captain. A curious thing. I made inquiries immediately, but the editors were not
to be found, in spite of all my pains. They do not seem to be in existence. Or
else they are gone. I scarcely know what to think of the paper, my dear
Captain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then for a few days Michael Petroff would wander
disconsolately about, and his depression might even bring on melancholia or
frenzy. But after a few days he would always regain his cheerful spirits. He
would greet his friends, and apologize for his disagreeable behavior. And
immediately he would begin to plan out another newspaper. This time it must
surely be a success. Take care. Dr. März!</p>

<p class="normal">Such was Michael Petroff, Captain in the Russian army.</p>

<p class="normal">Friend Engelhardt, whom Michael Petroff and the lawyer were
going to visit, was a gray-haired man about fifty years old, who had been only a
year in Dr. März's sanatorium. He was a shoemaker by trade and had sat all his
life, year in, year out, under his glass globe of water,[A] tapping away on
leather. He was unmarried, lived much alone and since he was industrious and
economical, he had laid up a comfortable little property. And there he sat under
his glass globe and nothing whatever happened. But gradually the globe began to
look more and more strange to him. It flashed upon him and dazzled him, so that
he sometimes felt for a moment a certain unacknowledged fear of it. It seemed to
grow bigger and bigger, until at last the time came when Engelhardt's hair stood
on end with horror&#8212;</p>

<p class="normal">
[Footnote A: German shoemakers used a glass globe full of water placed in front
of their lamp, to concentrate the light upon their work.]</p>

<p class="center"><a name="pix_70" href="#pixRef_70"><img src="images/hera.png" alt="Hera"></a></p>
<p class="center">Hera</p>
<p class="normal">And thenceforth he suffered from the strange and terrible
delusion that he was the centre of the universe and that it was his task to keep
the whole world in equilibrium. The myriad forces of all creation were united in
him and he felt with agonizing constancy, how the suns and the planets were
circling about him, and how everything was rushing and whirling through space.
If a chain of skaters revolves around one man who is in the middle, that man
will feel the extraordinary force with which the two rushing wings whirl around
him, and he will be obliged to exert all his strength to maintain his position.
Engelhardt felt precisely so and since his efforts were unremitting, his
delusion exhausted him to such an extent, that in one year he had aged as if in
ten. Even if&#8212;so he said&#8212;the heavenly bodies had been so marvelously ordained by
the almighty Creator, that through all eternity they revolved in their
foreordained circles and spirals (as he said), yet he suffered beyond endurance
from the slightest disturbance in outer space. During the winter he had been
unable to sleep for two weeks, because a swiftly moving star was pulling at him.
Curiously enough, at this very time a comet appeared which astonished all the
astronomers. Just then Schwindt, an attendant, had died under peculiar
circumstances and Engelhardt&#8212;as he himself said&#8212;had <i>drunk in</i> his soul,
from which he had gained fresh strength, sufficient to last him throughout the
spring and summer. But now again his task was wearing him out more every day and
his powers were failing rapidly. The shooting stars and the swarms of meteors
dragged at him, until he became dizzy, and especially the moon exerted at this
period a terrible power over him. It sucked in his strength, and Engelhardt
imagined that at any moment the ground might give way beneath him and he might
sink into the depths and the whole universe might collapse above him.</p>

<p class="normal">When Michael Petroff and the little lawyer entered
Engelhardt's room, after vainly knocking at the door for some time, they found
him in bed, with his thin hairy hands lying helplessly on the coverlet. He was
gazing directly upward, and indeed his eyes were rolled up so far that the
whites showed, and he seemed to be looking fixedly at some special point in the
ceiling. His face was of a somewhat yellowish tone and gave the impression of
being made of porcelain, the skin was so smooth and the bones were so prominent.
His forehead was uncommonly large in proportion to his small face and mouth,
which was drawn together as if ready to whistle and was surrounded by many
little lines centering at the lips. The shoemaker had wasted away so during the
year that the collar of his bright colored shirt stood out a finger's breadth
from his thin neck.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good morning!&quot; said Michael Petroff gently and cheerfully.
&quot;Here are some friends to see you!&quot; The lawyer remained timidly standing in the
doorway.</p>

<p class="normal">Engelhardt did not answer. A shudder passed over him, and his
thin hairy hands twitched from time to time, as if he were receiving an electric
shock of varying strength.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff smiled and came toward him. &quot;How are you, my
dear friend?&quot; said he softly and sympathetically, bending over Engelhardt. &quot;Did
the Doctor come to see you last night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Engelhardt rolled his head from side to side on the pillow. He
was exhausted by a sleepless night and by the effects of the hypnotics that the
Doctor had given him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very ill!&quot; answered he in a lifeless tone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very ill?&quot; Michael Petroff raised his eyebrows anxiously. He
turned to the little lawyer, who still stood at the door. &quot;Our poor friend does
not feel well!&quot; said he.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you in pain?&quot; Michael Petroff bent once more over the
sick man and held his ear near Engelhardt's mouth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the sick man in a dull and lifeless tone, and
murmured something in Petroff's ear. It sounded as if he were praying.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff straightened up again and glanced at the
little lawyer. &quot;He says that he has come to the end of his strength, our poor
friend. He needs a new soul&#8212;like that time in the winter, when the attendant
died, don't you remember?&quot; And he shouted into the ear of the sufferer,
unnecessarily loud: &quot;I will speak with the Doctor, Friend Engelhardt. This is
the Doctor's business. In one way or another he will get you a soul!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But the little lawyer suddenly wrapped himself closer in his
shawl. He was as cold as ice. Ordinarily very few impressions remained in his
memory, but he still remembered clearly the death of the attendant Schwindt&#8212;and
how Michael Petroff had come to his room and whispered mysteriously in his ear:
&quot;The attendant is dead. Engelhardt has taken his soul, don't you see!&quot; So now he
was horrified at the thought that Engelhardt might perhaps demand <i>his</i>
soul, and there was nothing that he feared more than death.</p>

<p class="normal">Death dwelt in his confused sick brain as a figure that was
invisible all but the hands. Suddenly, Oh so suddenly, it would stand near him,
close by his side. And a horrible chill would stream forth from the dread form,
and all the flowers, white with frost, would die, and the millions of swift
little birds would fall frozen through the air, and he himself would be changed
into a little heap of snow.</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer drew in his head, so that his thin gray beard
pushed out above his scarf, and gazed timidly at Michael Petroff with his little
mouse-like eyes and shivered.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff looked at him in astonishment. &quot;What is the
matter, my dear fellow?&quot; he drawled, smilingly. &quot;Are you afraid! Why should you
be, I wonder? I shall go at once to Dr. März and explain to him what Engelhardt
requires. From what I know of him, he will not delay, and so everything will be
attended to. I would gladly place my own soul at your disposal. Friend
Engelhardt, but I still need it myself&#8212;-I have a mission to fulfil, you know&#8212;I
am Napoleon, and I fight a battle every day, I am&#8212;&quot; But here he paused suddenly
and listened.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The Doctor is coming! Don't you hear him?&quot; he whispered. &quot;He
will be here immediately&#8212;&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Dr. März had come into the ward. He could be heard speaking
with some one in the corridor, and the three men in the shoemaker's room
listened. The Doctor's voice was the only one which had the power to change the
current of their thoughts and to give them hopes, great hopes, indefinite though
they were. It affected them somewhat as a voice affects wanderers, who believe
that they are lost in a solitary wilderness. And yet Dr. März did not talk much,
but he had become a master of the art of listening, and would pay attention for
hours every day to the complaints, the lamentations, and the hundreds of
requests of his patients. But a few words from him had the power to encourage,
to comfort, to cheer and to influence the mood of his patients for the whole
day.</p>

<p class="normal">Suddenly the lawyer ceased to shiver, Michael Petroff began to
laugh happily, and Engelhardt withdrew his gaze from the point in the ceiling
and looked toward the half open door. He gazed so intently that his small bright
eyes seemed to squint.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Listen! The Rajah is talking with him!&quot; said Michael Petroff,
holding up his finger for silence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nobody is watching you, my dear friend,&quot; said the Doctor's
quiet voice.</p>

<p class="normal">And a deep and almost gentler voice replied: &quot;I heard the
watchman walking back and forth before my door all night, Sir. And I also heard
the drum when the watch was relieved.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My friend,&quot; answered the Doctor, &quot;You must have been
dreaming.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; continued the man whom Michael Petroff had called the
&quot;Rajah,&quot; &quot;I excuse you, Sir, because I know that you are only doing your duty.
But your tact ought to prevent you from carrying out your precautions in such an
obvious way. I have given you my word of honor not to make any attempt to
escape. I want you to tell that to the English government, by whose authority
you are keeping me here in confinement. Neither have I any weapons concealed in
my room. I want you to search it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know that perfectly well, my friend!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All the same, I want you to search.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And the &quot;Rajah&quot; would not be satisfied until the Doctor had
promised that his room should be searched immediately.</p>

<p class="normal">During this conversation Dr. März had appeared in the doorway,
with the &quot;Rajah&quot; just behind him. Dr. März was a small man, dressed in a
light-gray suit, with a ruddy beardless face and a quick, searching but gentle
eye, while the &quot;Rajah&quot; stood behind him, tall and dark, and almost filling up
the doorway. The &quot;Rajah&quot; had a long black beard and a fearless, dark brown face,
in which the whites of his eyes showed strikingly.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; was simply a teacher, who had taught for a few
years in India in a German school. A protracted fever had caused an incipient
delusion, which, after his return to his native land, took entire possession of
him. He imagined himself to be an Indian prince, who had been exiled by the
English government.</p>

<p class="normal">He was extremely silent and reserved, and never talked with
the other patients. His bearing expressed an inscrutable calm and an apparently
quite natural pride. For days together he would favor no one with a glance. He
would walk up and down the garden, very slowly, gazing scornfully at the flowers
and trees, and every evening, if the weather permitted, he would sit apart on a
bench and gaze at the sinking sun, turning his dark face toward it until it
disappeared. And as he gazed at the setting sun, an obscure, wistful sorrow
glowed in his dark eyes. For he saw palm trees, that seemed to melt into the
sun, so that only their tops showed, edged with flame, while their trunks were
invisible&#8212;and elephants, stepping proudly, with their little brown
<i>mahouts</i> upon their necks&#8212;and glittering golden temples, and crowds of
dark, half naked natives, trotting along with branches in their hands, and
uttering shrill cries&#8212;and then too, he saw himself, going on board the steamer
that was to carry him into exile, while the dark people threw themselves down on
the quay and wept. The &quot;Rajah's&quot; soul was filled with deep and bitter sorrow,
and he rose and held his broad shoulders more erect, as if he were bearing a
heavy burden. And he bore it! The &quot;Rajah&quot; never complained, never showed
despondency, nor did he ever show any sign of what was taking place within him.</p>

<p class="normal">Even in his own room he behaved tranquilly. Very rarely was he
heard to speak, and only once in a while&#8212;in his sleep&#8212;would he utter a
long-drawn singing cry, such as street venders use in the Orient.</p>

<p class="normal">As Dr. März entered the room, the little baldheaded lawyer
bowed, with his cap in his hand, and stood modestly against the wall. His
gratitude knew no bounds, because the Doctor allowed him to live quietly and
peacefully among his flowers and birds, without ever asking him to pay anything.
So today he did not even venture to ask Dr. März for crumbs for the birds nor to
complain of the negligence of the maids in the kitchen, although he had fully
determined to do so.</p>

<p class="normal">But the lawyer could not look at the &quot;Rajah&quot; who stood dark
and unapproachable in the passageway, without feeling timid and slightly
anxious. To express his respect, he bowed low to the &quot;Rajah,&quot; and since the
latter did not notice him, he bowed once more, moving his lips in a whisper. But
the &quot;Rajah&quot; did not vouchsafe him a glance. For a moment the lawyer thought of
approaching and kissing the &quot;Rajah's&quot; hand. For he recalled a circumstance that
had been sharply impressed upon his memory: One evening he had met the &quot;Rajah&quot;
in the corridor and had bowed to him. They had been quite alone. The &quot;Rajah&quot; had
come toward him and had said in a deep, mysterious voice, &quot;My loyal subject!&quot;
and had given him his hand to kiss. &quot;Wait!&quot; the &quot;Rajah&quot; had continued, &quot;I will
show my favor to you. I have very little of the treasure left, that I brought
with me into exile, but&#8212;here, take this.&quot; And the &quot;Rajah&quot; had slipped a little
gray stone into his hand.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff, on the contrary, looked smilingly and
questioningly at Dr. März, while he stood politely back against the door.
Meanwhile he tipped his head somewhat backward and sidewise and looked at the
Doctor, as if he expected some very special news from him and as if he knew
quite well that Dr. März had such news for him today. So confidently did he look
at him, while a smile played about his pretty boyish mouth.</p>

<p class="normal">But Engelhardt, whose brows were drawn up with pain as if they
were fastened with rivets, had half sat up in bed and was explaining his needs
and his sufferings to the Doctor. He spoke in a guttural tone, rapidly, in a
murmur that was hard to understand, and his voice sounded like the distant
barking of a dog, heard on a still night.</p>

<p class="normal">He had come to the end of his strength&#8212;the moon was drawing at
him!&#8212;in the night thousands of people had begged him on their knees not to give
them up to destruction&#8212;only a new soul could give him back his strength&#8212;he felt
that he was bending over more and more to the left and the whole universe might
collapse at any moment: all this he muttered indistinctly, confusedly, his
distressful eyes fixed pleadingly upon Dr. März.</p>

<p class="normal">Dr. März listened gravely, as did also Michael Petroff and
even the &quot;Rajah,&quot; who had stepped inside the door. And because they were all
listening so earnestly&#8212;especially the &quot;Rajah,&quot; whose large brilliant eyes were
fixed upon Engelhardt&#8212;the little lawyer was once more seized with fear. He felt
as if his legs were sinking through the floor, as if in a swamp, but just when
this fear was about to overwhelm him like black darkness, a bird lit on the
window-sill and chirped, and the lawyer seemed suddenly transformed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am coming!&quot; he whispered hurriedly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't go!&quot; said Michael Petroff softly, taking hold of his
arm. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was calling me!&quot; answered the lawyer and slipped quickly
away.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How he is hurrying!&quot; thought Michael Petroff, and heard
himself laughing inwardly. And presently he said to Dr. März, laying his hand
confidentially on his shoulder: &quot;The lawyer is certainly a clever, well educated
man&#8212;and yet he thinks that the birds call him! Between you and me, Doctor,
hasn't it ever occurred to you, that he is not quite right&#8212;?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">
After luncheon Dr. März's patients went out into the garden as usual. They
trotted along in little groups, one after the other, round and round the biggest
flower bed, at equal distances, silently, lost in thought. Only the &quot;Inventor,&quot;
a young man, sometimes paused, rested his hand on his side, put his other hand
to his forehead and gazed steadily at a point on the ground.</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer was watering his flowers and listening delightedly
to the thousands and thousands of birds that were hopping in the bushes and
treetops. Michael Petroff was in high good humor. There was news&#8212;! Just listen!
Just listen! He was smoking a cigarette that Dr. März had given him, and was
enjoying every whiff of it. He held the cigarette with his fingers coquettishly
crossed, and swung it in sweeping curves, as if he were taking off his hat to
some one, and at every whiff he drew, he stood still and blew the smoke up into
the sunny air and watched the blue cloud drift away. Everything gave him
pleasure. Even walking was a delight to him. His steps were short, his knees
sprung playfully; and he felt with delight how his toes crackled a little and
how the elastic balls of his feet rebounded in his thin soled shoes from the
ground, while his heels touched the path but lightly and his knees swung. When
he stood still, he set the muscles of his thighs, by a certain pressure of the
knees, and then enjoyed the firmness with which he stood there like a statue. He
was convinced that nothing could have knocked him down. He walked along smiling
and glancing cheerfully about him, as if to share his happiness. He greeted
everyone, and whenever he met an acquaintance he would tell him the great event
that had happened today.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Just hear this, my friend!&quot; he called out to the little
lawyer, who was standing on the lawn, stooping over a tulip bed to water the
flowers in the middle of it. &quot;Do come over here! There is such news! Oh, please
do come!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He waited with friendly impatience until the lawyer had
finished and came back to the path, meaning to go back to the well with his
empty green can. &quot;I want to tell you what has happened today,&quot; he began hastily,
&quot;His Majesty the king of Saxony has condescended&#8212;&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; the lawyer interrupted him in a whisper and
started to leave him, &quot;I am in a hurry. It is hot and the flowers are drying
up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will walk to the well with you,&quot; continued Michael Petroff
good humoredly, and walked rapidly beside the departing lawyer. &quot;I can tell you
just as well while we are walking. So I said to the Doctor today: 'Now, Doctor,
haven't you anything for me today?' 'No,' said he, 'my dear Captain, nothing at
all, I am sorry to say.' 'Really nothing,' said I, and I took him by the arm.
'Has not there been a single answer for weeks? Really nothing, Doctor?' He
looked at me and thought a while. 'Oh yes,' he said, 'I had almost forgotten. A
document did come for you. It is about that carpenter, you know, Captain.' 'A
carpenter, Doctor? I don't remember'&#8212;so I took out my memorandum book, in which
I enter all the documents that I send out: 'Where did the answer come from? From
Saxony? Ah!' said I, 'then it must be about the butcher's apprentice who was
condemned to death.' 'Yes,' said the Doctor, 'that is it. The fellow was a
butcher's apprentice.' And now listen, my friend. Because of my petition, his
Majesty the King of Saxony has condescended to pardon him. I must write a letter
of thanks to His Majesty this very day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How the sun burns today,&quot; the lawyer responded to Michael
Petroff's tale, and began to work the pump handle. &quot;All the flowers look so
wilted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ha, ha!&quot; laughed Michael Petroff. &quot;You're not listening at
all, are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">No, the lawyer was not listening. He was looking into his can
to see if it was full.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff looked at him a while with his head on one
side, then he laughed quietly to himself and walked rapidly away. He glanced
about the garden in search of some one to whom he could tell his cheerful tale.</p>

<p class="normal">Just then he espied the &quot;Rajah,&quot; who was walking up and down
in the vegetable garden between two beds of lettuce. According to his habit, the
&quot;Rajah&quot; was alone, and in a place where no one else would be apt to come.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff rose up on tiptoes and considered whether he
had better, with one jump, spring over the beds, which separated him by about a
hundred paces from the &quot;Rajah.&quot; He would only have to soar upward a very little
and he would be there. But he was afraid of being impolite to the &quot;Rajah&quot; or
perhaps of startling him, so he gave up the idea.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; was pacing up and down with his usual pride and
dignity, but today he was restless and troubled. Engelhardt's words about
preserving the equilibrium of the universe had taken possession of his mind. He
had been considering the matter, and after long and inexorable reflection he had
come to the decision that there was only one way&#8212;only one&#8212;</p>

<p class="normal">Just then Michael Petroff came up to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will you permit me to disturb you?&quot; he asked politely, taking
off his gray English traveling cap. &quot;I am Captain Michael Petroff.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; gazed at him earnestly with his glowing dark eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you want,&quot; he asked quietly.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff smiled. &quot;I want to tell you a piece of good
news,&quot; he began. &quot;This morning I said to the Doctor: 'Now, Doctor, haven't you
anything for me today&#8212;?'&quot;&#8212;And beaming with joy, he went on to tell the same
story that he had told a dozen times that day.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; listened in silence, looking thoughtfully at
Michael Petroff. Then he said: &quot;I should like to have a word with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am quite at your service!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah's&quot; eyes wandered over the garden slowly and with
dignity.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shall we go over to that bench?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; sat down, and with a condescending gesture invited
Michael Petroff to be seated also.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I see you writing all the time&#8212;&quot; he began,</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff lifted his cap. &quot;Michael Petroff, Captain in
the Russian army,&quot; he said politely.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; looked at him and went on, with his usual quiet
pride: &quot;Since you write, you must understand. And you surely must have gained
knowledge of men and things from sacred books, which are closed to the rest of
us, and you must have passed your life in meditation, according to the rules of
your caste. Very well. Then explain to me the words of the Fakir, who, according
to the inscrutable decision of the Gods, is bearing up the universe on his
shoulders. Speak!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff smiled, highly flattered, and bowed to the
&quot;Rajah.&quot; He did not really understand all that the &quot;Rajah&quot; said, but he
perceived that his words expressed respect and admiration. He felt that it was
in some way his duty to confide to the &quot;Rajah&quot; the secret of his paper, but to
his own surprise he asked: &quot;You mean our friend Engelhardt?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You heard what he said?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then speak!&quot; It appeared that the &quot;Rajah&quot; had not forgotten a
single word that Engelhardt had said to Dr. März. Michael Petroff, on the
contrary, remembered almost nothing, and so fell into the &quot;Rajah's&quot; disfavor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pardon me!&quot; he apologized. &quot;So many things pass through my
head.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But what will happen if he cannot get another soul?&quot; asked
the &quot;Rajah.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, the Doctor will take care of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Even Fakirs are only human. What will happen if his strength
gives way? Will the world collapse?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Surely it will collapse!&quot; replied Michael Petroff, laughing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What are you laughing at?&quot; asked the &quot;Rajah&quot; quietly, while
his dark eyes gleamed. &quot;What will you do if it collapses?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I?&quot; Michael Petroff smiled and pointed to the cottage, which
showed dimly through the shrubbery. &quot;If that house tumbles down,&quot; he went on, &quot;I
will run away as fast as I can, and go back to my own country. Russia is my
native land. Do you know about Russia? You could hold Germany on the palm of
your hand, but you couldn't carry Russia even on your back. My country is so
big.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; considered this idea long and carefully.</p>

<p class="normal">Then he said slowly, and as if speaking to himself: &quot;If the
world collapses, will my kingdom be destroyed too? The mountains and the
temples, the forests and the towns, will they all fall in ruins?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff nodded, laughing maliciously. &quot;I suppose so!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And now the &quot;Rajah&quot; nodded too. He bowed his head slowly
several times. &quot;All my subjects would be destroyed?&quot; he asked, and nodded. He
rose and shook his head. &quot;No,&quot; he said solemnly, gazing at Michael Petroff.
&quot;That must not be! We cannot allow it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; turned away. Through the sunshine he walked,
slowly and with dignity, back to the ward.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff looked after him. He smiled and shook his
head. &quot;What a curious being he is though!&quot; said he, laughing. And when he heard
his own laughter, he laughed again, loudly and gaily and snapped his fingers.
Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p class="normal">But the &quot;Rajah&quot; went to Engelhardt's room and informed him
that he had decided to give up his own soul to him. &quot;If the Gods deign to accept
my sacrifice.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Engelhardt, who lay in his bed as if he were already dead,
opened his eyes and looked at the &quot;Rajah.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will you?&quot; he gasped, while his hands and face twitched
convulsively.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will try to hold out for three days yet!&quot; gasped
Engelhardt.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; closed the door. He went to his own room and
wrote, in a large rapid hand that wandered in all directions, a short letter to
Dr. März.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your Excellency,&quot; he wrote, &quot;It is the will of Heaven. We
shall see the blue river no more. We shall see no more the flooded rice fields,
nor the white elephants with bands of gold upon their tusks. It is the will of
Heaven and we obey. Say to the English Government that we are too noble for
bitterness or revenge. Say to the English Government that we are pleased to
rescue our subjects and to yield up our soul, if the sacrifice is pleasing to
the Gods.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; rang for the attendant and gave him the letter,
quietly and with great dignity. Then he undressed and went to bed, prepared to
die.</p>

<p class="normal">
At nightfall, when it was growing dark, the lawyer, much excited, rushed into
Michael Petroff's room, without knocking, or waiting at the door, as he was in
the habit of doing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Help me. Captain!&quot; he whispered, and threw himself into the
arms of the astonished Michael Petroff. The lawyer was trembling with fright.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What in the world&#8212;?&quot; exclaimed Michael Petroff, surprised and
startled.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is standing in the corridor!&quot; whispered the lawyer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who? What is the matter with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Engelhardt! He is standing at the 'Rajah's' door. He is
taking away his soul.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What's that you say?&quot; Michael Petroff laughed softly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I saw him standing there. Don't let him come near me. Oh good
God!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hush!&quot; interrupted Michael Petroff. &quot;I will attend to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer clung to his knees. &quot;He will come in here! Oh my
God, my God!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear friend,&quot; Michael Petroff reassured him, &quot;control
yourself. He shall not come in here. I promise you. But I must go and see!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The little lawyer cowered on the floor and covered his face
with his hands. But Michael Petroff left the room. After a while he came back,
looking somewhat pale, but laughing to keep his courage up.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said in a low tone, &quot;he is standing at the 'Rajah's'
door listening. What makes you tremble so, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't leave me!&quot; whispered the lawyer, still covering his
face with his hands.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; lay motionless in his bed, gazing far, far away
with his great, brilliant eyes. His swarthy face was transfigured by a solemn
peace and resignation. He declined to get up and refused all nourishment. Dr.
März took his temperature and found it somewhat low, and his pulse rather slow,
but he could not discover any symptoms of bodily disorder or of an approaching
illness. With cheerful earnestness he advised the &quot;Rajah&quot; to get up and to eat,
but as the &quot;Rajah&quot; did not answer, he left him in peace. He was accustomed to
his patients' whims and knew that they went as suddenly as they came.</p>

<p class="normal">But Engelhardt, on the contrary, caused him great anxiety. In
spite of long continued baths and all sorts of quieting treatments, he had
passed another sleepless and excited night. He now lay in a sort of half sleep,
and shrank and trembled with the effort that his horrible delusion required of
him. He heard voices, the cries of millions of men, who wrung their hands and
begged him not to give them up to destruction, he heard the ringing of bells,
the chanting of processions, the prayers of emperors and kings, bishops and
popes. His skin was dry and parched, his pulse was rapid and unsteady. Dr. März
sat for a long time by his bedside watching him attentively, and sometimes,
closing his eyes for a moment, he would recall with lightning rapidity all his
knowledge and experience of such cases. At last, with a thoughtful and baffled
air, he left Engelhardt.</p>

<p class="normal">But an hour later he was beside him again.</p>

<p class="normal">The patients in the ward showed that special form of
nervousness that was always present whenever the frequent visits of the doctor
indicated that some one was very ill. They walked quietly, spoke in undertones,
and many of them refused to leave the room at all. The little lawyer hardly
dared to stir and begged the thousands of birds, that lived in his room, to be
very quiet, when he put their bread and water on the table. Again and again some
unknown power drove him to look through the keyhole. He would stand there a long
time, covering his left eye with his hand as children do and peering with his
right at the white wall of the corridor. But whenever a passer-by darkened his
outlook, he would shrink back startled. If he had to go out to attend to his
flowers, he opened the door slowly and silently and walked backward, fixing his
eyes on Engelhardt's door, until he reached the steps. There he would turn
quickly and hurry away, possessed by the fear that a hand would suddenly seize
him by the coat collar.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff was the only one upon whom the general
restlessness had no effect. He sat at his writing table, cut out his cases,
numbered, registered, pasted, wrote. He shook his head smilingly over the little
lawyer's terror, but promised him his protection in any case.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Make your mind easy, my friend!&quot; said he patronizingly. &quot;So
long as I am living, you have no cause for anxiety!&quot; And with a pompous air he
added: &quot;I have been to see him. He told me that the &quot;Rajah&quot; had promised him his
soul. Voilà tout. You may rely on Michael Petroff!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thank you!&quot; whispered the lawyer, and started to kiss
Michael Petroff's hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh no! Why should you?&quot; said Michael Petroff, but he felt
pleased and flattered.</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer was calmer as he turned away. But in the night he
heard Engelhardt crying out and crept under the bedclothes with his teeth
chattering. It seemed to him as if he were buried in the ground, on a high
mountain and he scarcely dared to breathe for fear. But just then he saw an
enormous flock of birds flying swiftly over the sky in a gentle curve. He
beckoned to them and called out: &quot;Where are you going?&quot;&#8212;&quot;Come too, come too!&quot;
chirped the birds in answer. &quot;To Vienna, to Vienna!&quot; and they flew away in the
distance. The lawyer gazed after them and fell asleep.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah's&quot; strength failed visibly, although artificial
nourishment was given him, by Dr. März's orders. He was fading away as fast as
twilight in the tropics. His brown face and hands had taken on a dull gray hue,
like dry garden earth, and his broad and powerful chest rose and sank rapidly
and silently under the bedclothes. His eyelids, which were paler than his face,
drooped so as to half cover his eyes, but as soon as any one entered the room,
they opened slowly, and his large, brilliant eyes rested questioningly on the
newcomer.</p>

<p class="normal">His pulse was growing weak and rapid, and Dr. März sat almost
constantly at the sick man's bedside. The rapid loss of strength was
incomprehensible to the Doctor, and the inexplicable and rapid decline of the
heart action caused especial anxiety. He sat there, closing his eyes from time
to time, observed the patient, considered, tried all conceivable means&#8212;and by
evening he knew that the &quot;Rajah&quot; was beyond all human aid.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How is he, Doctor?&quot; asked Michael Petroff, who had been
watching for the Doctor in the corridor, and nodded his head toward the
&quot;Rajah's&quot; door.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, not so badly off!&quot; answered Dr. März absentmindedly.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff laughed softly behind his back. Then he went
at once to the lawyer's room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The 'Rajah' is dying!&quot; he said with a triumphant glance.</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer looked up at him timidly; he did not answer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes!&quot; Michael Petroff sat down in a cane-seated chair, and
drew up his trousers a little, so as not to get them out of shape at the knees.
&quot;I asked the Doctor just now. He answered: 'Not so badly off.' Now that means
that the 'Rajah' is dying. When Heinrich was dying, Heinrich who used to sing
the jolly songs that you laughed at so, my friend, what did the Doctor say? 'Not
so badly off!' And Heinrich died. Oh yes! I understand the doctors.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The little lawyer wrapped himself in his shawl. He was
freezing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is sucking the soul out of his body,&quot; continued Michael
Petroff with an important air. &quot;He understands his business, Engelhardt does.
How did he manage with Schwindt, the attendant? The very same way, don't you
see!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And Michael Petroff left the room, rubbing his hands
cheerfully. He was interested in everything that went on around him, in
everything that he
<i>saw through</i>. There was news&#8212;! In the best of spirits, he sat down at his
writing table to give the final touches to his article: &quot;Doctor März arrested.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">
That very night, toward three o'clock, the &quot;Rajah&quot; died. It was a warm, still
night and the moonlight was so bright that one could read out of doors. The
patients were restless, they cleared their throats, walked up and down and
talked together. But once in a while they would all be silent: that was when
Engelhardt began to scream out. &quot;I can't bear it any longer!&quot; And then he would
declaim aloud the petitions that kings and princes addressed to him on their
knees.</p>

<p class="normal">The little lawyer had not dared to go to bed. He sat fully
dressed on the sofa, with all his blankets wrapped around him. And yet he was so
cold that his teeth chattered. Whenever Engelhardt began to cry out, he moved
his lips in prayer and crossed himself.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff, on the contrary, had gone to bed with
complete unconcern. He lay, with his arms under his head, and pondered over a
suitable title for his next paper. For this time he would take the Doctor by
surprise, he would catch him&#8212;just wait and see! What was the sense of a title
like the <i>Non-Partisan</i>, if you please? Could one overcome this
case-hardened Doctor with that? What? Oh, no, no. Surely not. The title must
smell of fire and brimstone. It must be like the stroke of a sword, like the
muzzle of a gun aimed at the Doctor&#8212;for Dr. März must be startled when he reads
the title! And after much reflection, Michael Petroff decided that this time he
would call his paper <i>The Sword of the Archangel</i>. He could plainly see
this Archangel sweeping obliquely forward, with terrible fluttering garments and
an appalling and angry mien, holding his sword with both hands somewhat backward
above his head. And this sword, that was as sharp as a razor and very broad at
the back, slit the firmament open and a steaming bloodred stream appeared. This
steaming red stream gave Michael Petroff a feeling of luxurious delight. He sat
up and said: &quot;Just wait! Ha, ha!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But suddenly he covered his eyes with his hand. A dim, longing
pain had come over him, and he could not tell why.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Michael Petroff&#8212;?&quot; said he softly, &quot;Michael Petroff&#8212;?&quot; and
the tears sprung to his eyes. And so, with his hand over his wet eyes and a
confused sorrow in his heart, he fell asleep.</p>

<p class="normal">He was sleeping soundly when he was awakened by a knock at his
door: &quot;It is I, the attendant, don't be startled.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is it!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The attendant stepped in and said in an undertone: &quot;Dr. März
told me to ask you to come. The teacher wants to speak to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The teacher?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The 'Rajah,' you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do not know what he wants of me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, Dr. März has sent for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very well, I will come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff rose and made his toilet slowly and
scrupulously. The attendant came back and begged him to hurry. Michael Petroff
was tying his cravat carefully. &quot;I am coming at once,&quot; said he impatiently, &quot;but
I can't make a call half dressed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Finally he was ready; he looked in the glass a moment, stroked
his moustache and stepped out.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh Captain!&quot; whispered the little lawyer through the crack of
the door, for the knocking and talking in Petroff's room had made him still more
anxious. &quot;I beg you&#8212;!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am in a hurry,&quot; answered Michael Petroff, and hastened
along the corridor. As he passed Engelhardt's door he heard him declaiming: &quot;We
pray thee, do not destroy the dome of the world. Praised be thy name!&quot; And with
an altered, gasping voice Engelhardt went on: &quot;I am struggling, I am
struggling&#8212;!&quot; In the room overhead a step went restlessly up and down, back and
forth, like the distant throbbing of a machine.</p>

<p class="normal">Then the attendant opened the door of the &quot;Rajah's&quot; room and
Michael Petroff stepped in.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good morning!&quot; said he, loudly and cheerfully, as if it were
broad daylight and as if the &quot;Rajah&quot; were not a dying man. &quot;Good morning,
Doctor. Here I am.&#8212;Good morning&#8212;Prince!&quot; he added more softly after a glance at
the &quot;Rajah.&quot; &quot;Michael Petroff, Captain in the Russian army.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah's&quot; appearance had greatly impressed Michael
Petroff. The &quot;Rajah&quot; was sitting up in bed with his great dark eyes fixed upon
him. A shaded electric light burned above his head, but in spite of the dim
light the &quot;Rajah's&quot; face, framed by his dark hair and beard, shone like dull
gold, yes, it positively shone. And it was this strange brightness which had so
impressed Michael Petroff that he spoke more softly and addressed him as Prince.
He had, in fact, never seriously considered who the &quot;Rajah&quot; really was. He was a
Prince, who possessed a great kingdom somewhere and lived in exile. Now Michael
Petroff believed all this without thinking very much about it. Yet at this
moment he
<i>understood</i> that the &quot;Rajah&quot; was a Prince, and he entirely altered his
bearing toward him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You were pleased to send for me?&quot; said he, with timid
hesitation, and bowed.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; turned his face toward Dr. März.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thank you, Sir,&quot; he said, in a deep, quiet voice, whose
tone had changed. &quot;I know that you could have refused me this favor, since I am
your prisoner.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear friend&quot;&#8212;answered the Doctor, but the &quot;Rajah&quot; paid no
further attention to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I sent for you,&quot; he said, turning to Michael Petroff, &quot;in
order that you may write down my last will and testament.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am at your disposal,&quot; answered Michael Petroff, bowing
slightly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then write what I tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff felt in his pockets confusedly. &quot;I will run,&quot;
said he, &quot;I will be back at once&quot;&#8212;and he left the room rapidly, to bring pencil
and paper from his office.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Michael Petroff&#8212;&quot; whispered the little lawyer pleadingly.
&quot;You are leaving me&#8212;?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The 'Rajah' commands me!&quot; answered Michael Petroff
impatiently, and hurried past the trembling lawyer's little outstretched hands
back to the dying man's room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here I am, pardon me?&quot; he stammered breathlessly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then write!&quot; said the &quot;Rajah.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Michael seated himself properly and the &quot;Rajah&quot; began:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We, Rajah of Mangalore, banished by the English Government,
too noble to harbor feelings of revenge toward our enemies, since we are dying,
in order to rescue our subjects, make known to our people:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We greet you, our people! We greet the palm forests that
shelter the temples of our ancestors! We greet the blue river that refreshes our
land!&quot;&#8212;</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff, who was writing busily and industriously what
the &quot;Rajah&quot; dictated, looked up as the &quot;Rajah&quot; paused. He saw that two great
tears were falling from the &quot;Rajah's&quot; brilliant dark eyes. They ran down his
thin but strangely glowing cheeks into his beard.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; raised his hand with a dignified gesture. Then he
went on to the end calmly and majestically:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We grant a universal amnesty! All our dungeons and prisons
are to be opened and then burned to ashes. From this time forth no more blood
shall be shed!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, my Lord&#8212;my Prince&#8212;!&quot; whispered Michael Petroff as he
wrote.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There shall no longer be an army in our land and no man shall
go begging with his bowl. The treasure in our vaults shall be equally shared
among our people. Neither castes nor classes shall exist from this time forth.
All men shall be equal and all shall be brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The aged shall have their huts to die in, and to the children
we bequeath the meadows to play in. To the sick we grant health, and to the
unhappy sleep, quiet sleep. There shall be no more war and no more hatred
between the peoples, whatever their color, for so we decree. The judges shall be
wise and just, and to evil doers one must say: Go and be happy, for unhappiness
causes evil doing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To mankind we grant the earth, that they may occupy the same,
to the fish we give the waters and the sea, to the birds the heavens, and to the
beasts the forests, and the meadows that lie hidden amongst them!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But you, our own people, we bless and kiss you, for we are
dying.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; raised his hands in benediction and sank back upon
the pillows.</p>

<p class="normal">All who were present remained motionless and gazed at him. His
chest rose and fell feebly and rapidly while his lids drooped over his eyes and
showed like bright spots in his dark face.</p>

<p class="normal">Dr. März stepped gently to the bedside.</p>

<p class="normal">Just then the &quot;Rajah&quot; smiled. He threw his head back and
opened his lips, as if he were going to sing. But only a thin, musical cry
passed his lips, so high, so thin and so far away that it seemed as if the
&quot;Rajah&quot; were already calling from some distant realm. It was the cry of the
street venders in the Orient.</p>

<p class="normal">The &quot;Rajah&quot; was dead.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff stood on tiptoes and gazed with parted lips at
the pale, mysteriously beautiful face that shone beneath the rich dark hair. He
felt a sense of shame. He had lived so long with him who was now dead, without
realizing who he was. He longed to kneel beside the dead man's bed and whisper:
&quot;Prince, my Prince!&quot; But he did not dare to approach, he was afraid and stole
out of the room.</p>

<p class="normal">
After a while, when Dr. März stepped out into the corridor, he was impressed by
the quiet that reigned in the ward. There was not a sound to be heard. The
muffled tread overhead, that had paced back and forth for hours, was still. And
Engelhardt had ceased crying and groaning.</p>

<p class="normal">Dr. März went to the shoemaker's door. All was as still as
death within. He opened the door and listened. Engelhardt&#8212;was sleeping! His
breathing was deep and regular ... Dr. März shook his head and went thoughtfully
out of the ward. On the steps leading to the garden he lit a cigar and turned up
his coat collar. He was shivering.</p>

<p class="normal">So now he is asleep, thought he, as he walked through the
moonlit garden, where the bushes cast long, pale shadows. Is there any
discoverable connection between the teacher's death and Engelhardt's sleep? And
he thought of one of his colleagues, who would invent a connection in any case,
and then he thought how much he would enjoy a cup of strong coffee just now.
Suddenly he paused, slightly startled. In the moonlight a little man, all
wrapped up, was moving. It was the lawyer.</p>

<p class="normal">The little man had passed the whole night shivering and
trembling in his dark room. But when the first cock crowed he had slipped out of
the ward to water his flowers.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hush, hush!&quot; he whispered to the thousands of little birds
that began to chirp in the bushes as soon as he came near. &quot;Sleep a bit longer,
little ones!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And while he was watering the flowers, he quite forgot the
night, the &quot;Rajah,&quot; and Engelhardt who needed another soul, and began to smile.
&quot;Good morning, my pets,&quot; he said softly, &quot;here I am, I have come back to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But in Michael Petroff's room the light was burning.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael Petroff was sitting at his writing table, smiling and
goodhumored, writing diligently. For the impression that the &quot;Rajah's&quot; death had
made upon him had vanished as quickly as the tears that he had shed for him. He
was now working on an article which he regarded as a marvelously important
contribution for his newspaper. And this work brought back his happy cheerful
spirits.</p>

<p class="normal">In the neatest characters he wrote:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A telegram! The Rajah of Mangalore&#8212;against whose exile we
have registered our telegraphic protest with the English Government&#8212;fell gently
asleep tonight toward three o'clock. We had the honor to be present at his
deathbed and to draw up the last will and testament of this great ruler. We will
favor our readers with a copy:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'We, Rajah of Mangalore, banished by the English Government,
too noble to harbor feelings of revenge toward our enemies, since we are dying,
in order to rescue our subjects, make known to our people ...'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Only as the sun rose did Michael Petroff lie down to rest.</p>

<h2><a name="div2_drama" href="#div2Ref_drama">THE CONTEMPORARY GERMAN DRAMA</a></h2>

<h3>By <span class="sc">Amelia von Ende</span></h3>


<p class="normal">A period of transition in a nation's life is not the best
foundation upon which to rear a new literature. The change of religious, moral,
I social and political standards from their well-established and time-honored
base to new and untried planes does not favor the development of minds,
well-defined and well-balanced, and of characters, able to translate a clear
purpose into consistent achievement.</p>

<p class="normal">Germany passed through such a change toward the end of the
nineteenth century. The unification of the Empire with its era of material
prosperity and progress strengthened the roots of national consciousness; the
gospel of the superman with its absolute ego-cult stimulated individual
self-assertion; the wave of altruism which swept across the world at the same
time roused the slumbering sense of social responsibility. These three
forces&#8212;national consciousness, individual self assertion, social
responsibility&#8212;profoundly affected the character of the young generation growing
up in the newly reestablished Empire. Embracing each of these principles in
turn, theorizing about them, the young men and women of the time became
unsettled. With the gradual realization of the seriousness of the underlying
ideas grew the desire to experiment with them in life, to prove them by
practice. In the attempt to live these new ideals the individual became involved
in a conflict with the old conscience that no philosophy had yet been able to
argue away, and the road out of this dilemma lay along the line of least
resistance, which consisted in drifting with the changing tides. The result was
the gradual evolution of a type of hero which modified the drama of the country.
While the hero of old encountered and conquered obstacles mainly of external
circumstance and complication, the hero of the present is the victim of doubts
and moods rooted within himself, defeating his purpose and paralyzing his will.</p>

<p class="normal">The modern German drama deals with these conditions and
characters. The writers whose creative instinct awoke in the seventies stood
upon the firm ground of old traditions and were inspired by the optimism of the
national renascence. The writers who responded to the same instinct in the
eighties stood on the plane of a philosophy which had undermined the old
traditions and conventions and had not yet crystallized into constructive
principles that could safely guide the individual through life. Their souls
wavered between self-realization and self-renunciation; their minds eagerly
followed the example of Ibsen inquiring into individual motives and
responsibilities, and their eyes were at the same time opened to the economic
struggle of the masses which had roused the social conscience. A world unknown
to the poets of the previous generation, or ignored by them, had come within the
range of vision; it engaged not only the humanitarian's sympathy and the
philosopher's speculation, but the artist's interest. It was studied for its
scientific meaning and exploited for its esthetic possibilities.</p>

<p class="normal">The floodgates of a literature rich in stimulating ideas were
opened and the new subject-matter demanded a new manner, a new style. The
influence of Darwin was not lost upon the young generation. The significance of
circumstance and environment in the making of man led to a minute painting of
the milieu, of the external setting of each individual life at every moment of
its existence in drama or fiction. The language of the characters became the
language of their class in ordinary life. The action was immediately and
directly transferred to the written page and became a record of unadorned
reality. The cry for truth became one of the party cries of the period.
Naturalistic fiction and naturalistic drama came into being.</p>

<p class="normal">Within the brief space of less than twenty-five years were
born three men whose literary personalities represent this development of German
drama. Ernst von Wildenbruch in the main held fast to the traditions of the
past, which he treated in historical plays in the manner of a poet who had
matured in the period of Germany's unification and was inspired with the
consciousness of national renascence. Hermann Sudermann, who rose on the horizon
just as the old traditions began to weaken, chose to ignore the past, took his
cue from the social note of the present, but sought a compromise with the old
forms and with the taste of the great mass of the people. Gerhart Hauptmann, the
youngest of the three, discarded all precedent and built upon new foundations
with new material in a new manner. By the success which he gained in spite of
his uncompromising attitude, he became the leader of the young generation.</p>

<p class="normal">The intellectual atmosphere in the decade that witnessed the
advent of Sudermann and Hauptmann was extraordinarily alive and stimulating and
the drama was chosen by an amazing number of young aspirants to literary fame as
the vehicle of the message they had for the world. The plays of the period
suggest the fermentation going on in the young brains, the unsettling of old and
the dawn of new creeds, religious, social and esthetic. The clash of two
generations became one of the most popular themes. Cæsar Flaischlen, a Suabian,
handled it most thoughtfully and effectively in <i>Martin Lehnhardt</i>. Though
the author modestly called it &quot;dramatic scenes,&quot; it was a play presenting with
spirited rhythm a phase of the spiritual revolution and moral revaluation then
taking place, and in the orthodox uncle and the radical nephew he created two
figures full of real dramatic life. The well-to-do and well-satisfied
middle-class with its somewhat shopworn ideals was a popular topic with these
young men who lustily set about to demolish the Mosaic and other codes of life.
Otto Erich Hartleben was hailed as the Juvenal of the society of his time,
flaying it mercilessly in satirical comedies like <i>Education for Marriage</i>, <i>
The Moral Requirement</i>, and <i>Rose-Monday</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">Whatever were the shortcomings of these young hot-spurs, there
is no doubt that there were among them earnest seekers for new values of life
and letters. Many were contented with pathetic seriousness and doubtful results
to imitate their successful and popular model, Gerhart Hauptmann. Some made no
attempt at concealing that they walked closely in the footsteps of their master.
Nor did the critics of the new school esteem them any less for being followers
and imitators rather than creators of independent merit. Among these youths,
Georg Hirschfeld, a born Berliner, was the most promising. He was of a type
abundant in every metropolis having an intense intellectual life: sensitive,
impressionable, with an amazing talent for absorption and adaptation and a
facile gift of language. The reception accorded to his drama.
<i>The Mothers</i> (1896), which was frankly reminiscent of Sudermann's contrast
between the front and the rear house and of Hauptmann's dialogue of real life,
was so generous, that it gave the author, then barely twenty-three, a position
quite out of proportion to his achievement. His efforts at following up the
easily won success made him a pathetic figure in the drama of that decade. He
experienced failure upon failure and has now, after the publication of some
stories of varying merit and the stage success of a clever comedy directed
against the esthetes&#8212;<i>Mieze and Maria</i>&#8212;once more dropped out of sight.</p>

<p class="normal">A far more robust figure came to the fore in Max Halbe, a West
Prussian and an individuality deeply rooted in the soil of his forefathers. That
soil and his close kinship with nature gave Halbe a firmer foundation than the
shifting quicksands of metropolitan life offered. These were the premises upon
which he set out to build. But he would not have been a child of his time had he
not seen life through the temperament of his generation. With all his sturdy
mental and moral fibre he could not withstand the torrential current of
skepticism and revaluation that swept through the intellectual world and
uprooted its spiritual mainstays. Though the action of his plays was based upon
eternal conflicts of the human tragi-comedy&#8212;the irreconcilable contrast between
two generations, between two orders of life, between love and duty&#8212;his
characters are of the new type, his unheroic heroes are like the men he saw
about him, reeds swayed by the breath of the Zeitgeist, and true to the
naturalistic creed of his generation they were represented by him without any
attempt at idealization.</p>

<p class="normal">Halbe made his debut in 1889 with the tragedy of a peasant
parvenu. The play was fashioned according to old formulas, but of charming local
color and with more than a touch of the new type in one of the characters. This
was followed in 1890 by <i>Free Love</i>, the hero of which is one of those
individuals unable to reconcile their convictions with their actions&#8212;a conflict
which becomes a source of torture to themselves and those about them. The <i>
Ice-Floe</i> (1892) was a powerful drama, in which the sudden thaw, destroying
what has been, but bringing with it a breath of the spring and the new life to
come, admirably symbolized the passing of the old order. But it was not until
the following year, which saw the publication of his <i>Youth</i>, that Halbe
attracted serious attention outside of the circles of that Young Germany which
has become identified with the literary revolution.
<i>Youth</i> was of a human significance and of an artistic calibre which could
not well be ignored. This work presented the old theme of youth, love and sin in
the provincial setting that he knew so well; the characters were taken from real
life and portrayed with striking truthfulness. But over it all was the
atmosphere of spring, of sunshine and blossoms and thundershowers that quicken
the germs in the womb of the earth. This was suggested with a delicacy and a
chastity rare in the literature of that period of storm and stress. <i>Youth</i>
was the work of a true poet and would have been hailed as such even had the
author been born into a period less generous in its bestowal of praise upon the
works of the &quot;coming men.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In <i>Mother Earth</i>, published in 1897, Max Halbe shows
himself at his best both in spirit and in manner. The hero of that play is
estranged from his paternal hearth, with its ancestral traditions and from the
simple rural life and the innocent tender love of his youth. For he has gone to
Berlin, has drifted into the circles of the intellectuals, married the brilliant
and advanced daughter of a professor and become actively interested in feminist
propaganda. Subconsciously, however, this life does not satisfy him, and when on
the death of his father he returns to the old home and feels once more its
charm, he realizes that he has forfeited real happiness for a vague and alien
ideal. In this work with its firmly knit and logically evolved action Max Halbe
reached a climax in his development. Since its production his star has been
steadily declining and the thirteen or more works that have since come from his
pen have not added to his reputation. Embittered by his failures, he chose some
years ago to attack his rivals and critics in a satirical comedy. <i>The Isle of
the Blessed</i>, but he had miscalculated the effect of the poorly disguised
personal animosities upon an audience not sufficiently interested in the
author's friendships and enmities. He has, however, not become sadly resigned to
his fate, like Hirschfeld, but continues to court the favor of the stage with
the tenacity of a man disappointed in his hopes but unwilling to admit his
defeat.</p>

<p class="normal">An important aspect of the social and esthetic programme of
the new school was the unflinching frankness with which it faced a problem
belonging to intimate life and barring public discussion, yet closely connected
with the economic conditions of society: the problem of sex. The curious revival
of pagan eroticism in lyric poetry and the growing tendency toward a scientific
cynicism in fiction were supplemented by attempts to handle sex from the
standpoint of modern psychology and social ethics in drama. With works of that
class has the name of Frank Wedekind become inseparably associated. He is the
most positive intellect among the writers of Young Germany and their most
radical innovator in regard to form. He is a fanatic of truth and deals only
with facts; discarding the mitigating accessories of the <i>milieu</i>, he
places those facts before us in absolute nudity. This would make him the most
consistent naturalist; but when facts are presented bald and bare, they do not
make the impression of reality, but rather of grotesque caricature. Hence
Wedekind has sometimes been compared with early English dramatists and classed
with romanticists like Lenz, Grabbe and Heine. He himself has no esthetic
theories whatever that could facilitate his being enrolled under some fetching
label. Nor has he any ethical principles, some critics allege, if they do not
curtly call him immoral. Yet his work, from the appearance of <i>Spring's
Awakening</i> (1891) to his <i>Stone of Wisdom</i>, (1909) and his most recent
works, proves him to be concerned with nothing but the moral problem. He treats
social morality with mordant irony from an a-moral standpoint. The distinction
between a-moral and immoral must be borne in mind in any attempt to interpret
the puzzling and paradoxical personality of the author and to arrive at an
approximate understanding of the man behind his work.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="pix_100" href="#pixRef_100"><img src="images/shade.png" alt="In_the_Shade"></a></p>
<p class="center">IN THE SHADE</p>

<p class="normal">That Wedekind is not only an author, but an actor as well, has
in no small degree complicated his case. The pose seems so inseparably connected
with the art of the actor, that his intransigent policy in sex matters and his
striking impersonations of the characters in his plays have been interpreted as
the unabashed bid for notoriety of a clever poseur. But his acting could hardly
have made palatable to theatre audiences topics tabooed in polite conversation
and with appalling candor presented by him on the stage. Neither his quality as
actor nor his quality as author could account for the measure of popularity his
plays have attained. It would rather indicate that the German public was ready
for open discussion of the problems involved and that Wedekind's frankness and
honesty, his lapses into diabolical grimace and grotesque hyperbole
notwithstanding, met a demand of his time. Nor did he restrict himself to that
one particular problem. His irony spared no institution, no person: lèse-majesté
was one of his offenses; nor did he spare himself. Born into a generation which
took itself very seriously, he created the impression as if he at least were not
taking himself too seriously. Yet a survey of his work, regardless of the
comparisons and conclusions it may suggest, tends to substantiate the claim that
Frank Wedekind is not only an uncompromising destroyer of antiquated sentiment
and a fanatic of positive life, but a grim moralist. It is easy to recognize him
in some of his characters, and these figures, like the banished king in <i>Thus
is Life</i>, the secretary Hetman in <i>Hidalla</i>, the author Lindekuh in
<i>Musik</i>, and others, are always the tragic moralists in an immoral world.
There is something pathetic in the perseverance with which he is ever harping on
the one string.</p>

<p class="normal">For although he is now one of the more popular writers of his
generation, his attitude has not changed much in the course of his career. The
man who hurled into the world <i>Spring's Awakening</i>, is still behind the
social satirist who has become a favorite with theatre audiences through his
clever portrayal of a crook in <i>The Marquis of Keith</i> and of the popular
stage favorite in <i>The Court Singer</i>. He is little concerned with the
probability of the plot; his situations will not bear the test of serious
scrutiny. They are only the background from which the figure of the hero stands
out in strong relief. The popular tenor, who is an amusing combination of the
artist and the businessman, is one of the characters in the plays of Wedekind
that have little or no trace in them of the author himself. He is seen with
astonishing objectivity and presented with delectable sarcasm. The story of the
famous singer, who between packing his valise to take the train for his next
engagement, studying a new role, running over numerous letters from admirers,
makes love to the one caller he cannot get rid of, a woman who chooses that
inopportune moment to shoot herself before his eyes, is a typical product of his
manner, and a grotesque satire upon the cult of histrionic stars practised by
both sexes.</p>

<p class="normal">While the initiative in the literary revolution of which Halbe
and Wedekind are such striking examples was taken by Northern Germany and
centred in Berlin, Austria was not slow in adding a note of its own by giving
the German drama of the period two of its most interesting individualities. Both
Arthur Schnitzler and Hugo von Hofmannsthal&#8212;to whom might be added the clever
and versatile Hermann Bahr&#8212;reflect the complex soul of their native city,
Vienna; for if Austria is acknowledged to be a most curious racial composite,
Vienna contains its very essence. Situated at the parting of the ways for the
South and the Orient, it has ever been a much-coveted spot. After the conquest
of the original Celtic settlement by the Romans, Teutons, Huns, and Turks have
successively fought for its possession and have left their imprint upon its
physiognomy. Intermarriage with the neighboring Czechs and Magyars, the
affiliations of the court with Spain, Italy, and France, and the final
permeation of all social strata by the Hebrew element, have produced what may be
called the Viennese soul. Political conditions, too, have influenced it: to
maintain peace in a country which is a heterogeneous conglomerate of states
rather than an organic growth, requires a diplomacy the chief aim of which is to
prevent anything from happening. This attitude of the Viennese court and its
vast machinery of functionaries slowly affected other classes, until the people
of Vienna as a body seem to refrain from anything that means action. It is this
passive fatalism which has hampered the intellectual development of Vienna.
Oldest in culture among the German-speaking cities of Europe it has never been
and is not likely ever to be a leader.</p>

<p class="normal">Minds that entered upon this local heritage were only too
ready to receive the seeds of skepticism abundant in the spiritual atmosphere of
the century's end. But Nietzsche's gospel of the Superman, Ibsen's heretical
analysis of human motives and Zola's cry for truth did not affect the young
generation of Vienna intellectuals as they did those of Paris or Berlin, where
the revision of old standards of life and letters was promptly followed by
daring experiments with new ideals. Young Vienna heard the keynotes of the new
time, but it was content to evolve a new variety of an old tune. Time-honored
pessimism, world-sorrow, gave way to a sophisticated and cynical world-weariness
which is symptomatic of decadence. Widely different as their individualities
present themselves, between the pages of their books and on the stage, both
Schnitzler and Hofmannsthal reflect that attitude of mind.</p>

<p class="normal">In the work of Arthur Schnitzler the Hebrew element
predominates; it has quickened the somewhat inert Vienna blood and finds
expression in analytical keenness and sharpness of vision, a wit of Gallic
refinement and a language of sparkling brilliancy. Schnitzler's profession, too,
has not been without some influence upon his poetical work. A physician facing
humanity daily not in strength and health, but in weakness and disease, cannot
divest himself of a certain pessimistic bias. Brought up and practising in a
city like Vienna, he cannot escape the cynicism which belongs alike to the man
of the world as to the doctor before whom all veils and pretenses are discarded.
It is difficult, indeed, to banish the idea that the consultation-room of Arthur
Schnitzler, Dr. med., is the confessional which furnishes material to Arthur
Schnitzler, author. For the modern physician is not concerned with his patient's
body only, but also with his soul. He must be a psychologist as well, and the
success of his diagnosis depends upon his skill to unravel the intricate
interrelations between both. That Schnitzler is such a physician admits of no
doubt. His perspicacity as diagnostician lends subtlety to his analysis and
portrayal of characters. While his professional bias may in a manner limit the
range of his vision, his professional knowledge and experience are strong assets
of the dramatist Schnitzler.</p>

<p class="normal">The world that he knows best is the modern society of Vienna.
His heroes are mostly men engaged in a quest for the joys of life, but never
attaining whole-hearted enjoyment, because of their innate streak of
world-weariness. When the hero of his <i>Anatol</i> (1893) calls himself
&quot;light-hearted pessimist,&quot; Schnitzler creates a term which fits as well his
Fedor in <i>Märchen</i> (1894), his Fritz in <i>Liebelei</i> (1895), and other
specimens of a type related to the heroes of Musset and other Frenchmen. His
women, too, have a streak of French blood, both his &quot;sweet girls&quot; and his
married heroines; but unmistakably Austrian and Viennese is their willingness to
resign rather than to resist. Frau Gabriele give Anatol flowers to take to his
sweetheart and bids him tell her: &quot;These flowers, my ... sweet girl ... a woman
sends you, who can perhaps love as well as you, but had not the courage ...&quot; The
playlets collectively called <i>Anatol</i> are only scenes and dialogues between
two men or a man and a woman exchanging confidences. Limited as he seems in his
choice of themes and types, both by temperament and association, it is amazing
with what virtuosity Schnitzler varies almost identical situations and
characters until they are differentiated from one another by some striking
individual touch and when presented on the stage act with a new and potent
charm.</p>

<p class="normal">For that just balance of contents and form which makes for
perfection, Schnitzler's renaissance drama <i>The Veil of Beatrice</i> is the
most noteworthy specimen. But in all his work his style is his greatest
achievement. It is of a rare spontaneity, vivacity and grace&#8212;qualities that make
his dialogue appear an impromptu performance rather than a carefully planned
structure. It abounds in paradoxes that do not blind the vision, but reveal
vistas, and that do not impress as high lights added for effect, but as organic
parts of the whole. It scintillates with wit, though it lacks humor. It is the
just medium of expression for his characters, those types of modern
intellectuals, affected by the corrosive skepticism of the period and in turn
buoyed by the light-hearted temperament and depressed by the passive melancholy
that are indigenous to Vienna. It is this literary excellence that renders works
like <i>Literature</i> (1902) and <i>The Green Cockatoo</i> (1899) enjoyable to
readers to whom their spirit may be absolutely foreign. It is their polish that
robs their cynicism of its sting and brings into relief only their formal
beauty. <i>Literature</i> deals effectively with the literary exploitation of
intimate personal experience: it presents characters which with due local
modification can be found in every intellectual centre and is a little
masterpiece of irony. In <i>The Green Cockatoo</i> the poet has seen his theme
in a sort of phantasmagorical perspective; he plays with reality and appearance
in a play within a play which is unique in literature. He makes his spectators
feel the hot breath of the French Revolution without burdening them with the
ideas that were back of it. It is the most solidly constructed of his works and
the one most sure of success on any stage. Exquisite as is the art of
Schnitzler, it is deeply rooted in life and does not approach that art for art's
sake which was one of the striking phenomena of that period.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet the atmosphere of Vienna and the leisurely pace of its
life seem to favor the development of an art that has little or no connection
with the pressing realities of the day and is bent upon seeking the beauty of
the word rather than the truth of its message. Such a movement had been
inaugurated in German letters in 1890 by Stefan George, who gathered about him a
small group of collaborators in the privately circulated magazine <i>Blätter für
die Kunst</i>. It stood for a remoteness from reality which formed a strong
contrast to the naturalistic creed and for a formal craftsmanship which set out
to counteract the grooving tendency to break away from the fetters of
conventional forms. The work of the group bordered often upon archaic
preciosity, yet its influence was wholesome in holding up the ideal of a
formalism which is after all one of the basic conditions of art. Though not a
native of Vienna, Stefan George settled there after launching the movement and
found among its young intellectuals not a few disciples that have since followed
in his wake. There is something about an art for art's sake that appeals to an
aristocracy of birth and breeding; it touched a responsive chord in the soul of
Hugo von Hofmannsthal,[A] whose earlier work distinctly shows its influence and
who to that influence still owes his admirable mastery of form.</p>


[Footnote A: For Hofmannsthal, compare Vol. XVII, pp. 482-527.]


<p class="normal">Hofmannsthal's descent from an old nobility that had passed
the zenith of its power and was but little modified by a strain of the more
democratic Hebrew blood, seemed to predestine him for the part he has played in
the literature of the present. He made his debut as a mere youth of seventeen,
when in 1891 he published the dramatic study
<i>Yesterday</i>, giving evidence of an amazingly precocious mind and a
prematurely developed formal talent. Gifted writers of that kind are usually
doomed to remain prodigies whatever may be their medium of expression. Coming
into their heritage, which is the accumulated knowledge and experience of their
ancestors, before they have acquired a direct and profound grasp of life, they
seem to enter the world full-fledged, while it is only that ancestral heritage
that works through the impressions of the youthful brain and gives them the
color of age. Knowing and satiated when the mind is most receptive, such
individualities rarely develop beyond their first brilliant phase. Hugo von
Hofmannsthal was for a long time considered a perfect specimen of that type. For
the hero of that first work, as of every work published by him during the first
decade of his career, was his double, was Hofmannsthal himself. All the
virtuosity of style could not conceal the paucity of invention in subject matter
and in the creation of real living characters. Even in that charming Oriental
play <i>The Marriage of Sobeide</i> (1899) and <i>The Mine of Falun</i> (1906)
the personality of the author obtrudes itself upon the vision of the reader.</p>

<p class="normal">These works, however, marked a transition. For with his
thirtieth year Hofmannsthal entered upon a new period and a new manner. The
study of the antique Greek drama and of early English dramatists diverted him
from the self-absorption and self-reflection of his previous work, and may have
brought home to him the necessity of finding a more fertile source for his art
than his own individual soul. The extraordinary success of Wilde's <i>Salome</i>
opened possibilities of applying the pathological knowledge of the present to
the interpretation of the past. He chose for this momentous departure the <i>
Electra</i> of Sophocles (1903). Taking from the Greek poet the mere skeleton of
the story, he modified the characters according to his own vision and the
psychopathic viewpoint of the time&#8212;a liberty which some critics justified,
others branded as an unpardonable license. But the work was a turning-point for
Hofmannsthal, for he has since begun to face life more directly and squarely and
though he has not reached a wholesome reading of it, he has at least struck new
and powerful notes that contrast strongly with the spirit of his previous works.
Enforced by the music of Richard Strauss, whose naturalism is the immediate
expression of his robust virility, Hofmannsthal's <i>Electra</i> has made the
name of the author known throughout the world. To his association with the
sturdy Bavarian composer is also due the comedy <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> (1911),
which with its daring situations and touches of drastic burlesque harks back to
the spirit of the comedy of Molière's time, though in its way it is also a
product of the reaction against the puerile and commonplace inoffensiveness of
mid-century letters inaugurated by Young Germany. Since his association with
Richard Strauss has weaned Hofmannsthal from the somewhat effete estheticism and
pessimism of his youth, it is a matter of interesting conjecture what further
effect it may have upon his development.</p>

<p class="normal">It seems to follow with the inevitableness of a physical law,
that the alternate swing of the pendulum between a naturalism which set above
everything the material fact and the cry for truth, and a subtle estheticism
which set the word above the spirit, would in the end usher in an art that had
profited by and learned to avoid both extremes. There was little surprise when
the Royal Schiller prize, which had not been awarded for some years, was in 1908
divided between Karl Schönherr[A] for his play <i>Erde</i> and Ernst Hardt for <i>
Tristram the Jester</i>. For Schönherr, the Tyrolese, had drawn his inspiration
from the source which ever Antæsus-like renews the strength of humanity, and
Hardt had drawn upon the rich source of racial lore. But when a jury consisting
of men like Dr. Jacob Minor, Dr. Paul Schlenther, Hermann Sudermann, Carl
Hauptmann and others within a few weeks after that contest awarded the popular
Schiller prize also to Hardt and for the same play, with a competitor like
Hofmannsthal in the race, it seemed safe to argue that this unanimity indicated
a turn of the tide. Both Schönherr and Hardt stand for that sane eclecticism
which seems destined to pilot German drama out of the contrary currents to which
it has long been a prey toward a type more in harmony with the classical ideal.</p>


[Footnote A: For Schönherr, compare Vol. XVI, pp. 410-479.]


<p class="normal">Though comparatively unknown when he issued as victor from
those contests and suddenly obtained a measure of celebrity, Hardt was by no
means a novice in the world of letters. The first book bearing his name, <i>
Priests of Death</i> (1898), contained some stories of an epic dignity and a
dramatic rhythm that challenged attention and secured interest for the works
that followed. These were another volume of fiction, one of poetry, some plays
and a number of translations from Taine, Flaubert, Balzac, and other French
writers, which are remarkable specimens of his ability to grasp the spirit of a
foreign world and to convey its essence through the medium of his native tongue.
It seems natural that his familiarity with French literature had some influence
upon the character of his prize drama, since he had chosen for its topic a story
belonging alike to German and Gallic lore. To re-create the story of Tristan and
Isolde upon the foundation of the German source would have challenged comparison
not only with the cherished epic of Master Gottfried of Strassburg, but also
with the music-drama of Richard Wagner, who had treated it with something like
finality,&#8212;at least for the present generation. By going back to the old French
legend and to J. Bédier's book <i>Le roman de Tristan et Yseult</i> (1900), the
author was able to present that most tragic of all love-stories from a different
angle. By complicating the plot through the introduction of the second Isolde,
jealousy became the secondary, though hardly less powerful theme. This deviation
from the comparatively simple plot of the German story is of course more
difficult of comprehension upon the stage. It is not easy to convince an
audience that jealousy of Isolde White-hand, whom Tristan had married after
being banished from Cornwall, blinds Isolde Blond-hair into refusing to
recognize him when he returns and pleads his case before her in the disguise of
Tristram the Jester. Cavilling critics were quick to discover and to expatiate
upon this weakness of the play. But the fine lines upon which it is built and
the plastic figures standing out against the medieval background, the glowing
color, radiant lights and brooding shadows of its atmosphere, and lastly, the
language, the verse-form admirably adapted to the subject,&#8212;all this together
makes of the drama a work coming very near that perfect balance of contents and
form which is the ideal of art.</p>

<p class="normal">It is a rather circuitous path which German drama has traveled
since the memorable performance of Gerhart Hauptmann's play <i>Before Sunrise</i>
in 1889. It has outgrown the one-sided naturalism which had seemed the only
medium of translating life directly into literature. It has turned aside from
the orphic symbolism and verbal artistry rooted only in literature and having
nothing in common with life. Men like Karl Schönherr, Carl Hauptmann, and others
have found in the native soil and its people and in the problems that confront
that people at all times as rich a source of thematic material as previous
generations of poets had found in the historic past. Men like Ernst Hardt and
others have infused new life into the old legends of racial lore. As German
drama is completing this cycle of its development it gives hopeful evidence of
returning to the safe middle course of normal growth toward a new type,
indigenous to the soil and the soul of the country.</p>

<h2>MOTHER EARTH (1897)</h2>

<h3>A Drama in Five Acts</h3>

<h4>TRANSLATED BY <span class="sc">Paul</span> H. GRUMMANN, A.M.</h4>
<h4>Professor of Modern German Literature, University of Nebraska</h4>
<br>
<br>
<h2>ACT I</h2>

<p class="hang1">Ancient hall of the manor. Broad and spacious. Low ceiling. In
the rear wall, toward the garden, the bare trees of which are visible, three
wide windows with white crossbars. Chair at both ends of each window. A folding
card table between the chairs of the middle window. An Empire commode in each
space between the windows. In the centre of the two lateral walls, folding
doors, the one at the left leading into another room, the one at the right into
the vestibule. On the left, in the foreground, a sofa which is well preserved
and gives evidence of former elegance, and similar chairs with stiff backs and
light variegated covers, grouped around a large oval table. Opposite this in the
foreground at the right, an old-fashioned fireplace, before which three similar
chairs are placed. In the background at the right, near the window, a spinet
with a chair before it. In the corresponding place on the left near the window a
tall, gilt framed mirror resting on a cabinet base. An old fashioned chandelier,
ornate with gilt and glass, is suspended in the centre of the hall. A number of
pictures, men and women in the fashions of the last one hundred years, cover the
walls. Painted board floor. Rugs only before sofa and spinet. Furniture in light
mahogany. Wall paper of gilt design. Solid, but faded finery of the twenties and
thirties of the nineteenth century with a few more recent additions. The general
character of the hall is bright and inviting, nevertheless serious and somewhat
shut in by the low ceiling, giving the large room an air of emptiness, for the
scant furniture along the walls seems to be lost. A mixture of a dancing hall
and an ancestral portrait gallery. At present it looks gloomy, almost spectral.
It is an early morning near the end of December. As yet not a ray of sunlight
comes in through the heart-shaped apertures of the shutters, which are hung on
the outside and are fastened on the inside by means of thumbscrews. A lamp
stands at the extreme end of the room on one of the commodes. Beyond its radius
deep shadows gather on every side. In the foreground logs are burning brightly
in the fireplace. An indistinct light falls past the chairs over the foreground.
From the other side, the light of a candle falls upon the sofa table which is
covered with a white cloth. It also illumines only the immediate vicinity. Dusk
predominates in the spacious hall. At every passing and repassing great shadows
flit back and forth.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> stands on a chair under the
chandelier and slowly revolves it, scrutinizing it, and causing the glass prisms
to tinkle.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> in a fur coat and cap
stands at the door on the right and is about to go out.</p>
<br>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (with a heavy gray cloth
wrapped about her head, speaks down from the chair). Yes, just go and see,
Zindel, whether they are coming; see whether you can hear anything.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. Just so, Miss. I
shall be back right off. (He opens the door and runs into <span class="sc">Lene</span>,
who is about to enter with a tray full of dishes for the morning coffee.) Whoa!
Look out! Don't knock anything over! (Partly to himself.) Or the old man will
play us the trick and wake up again. (He goes out, and closes the door behind
him.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (speaking down from the
chair). Is it you, Lene?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (has come forward with the dishes,
shrinks so that the tray and dishes clatter). Heavens and all the saints! Why, I
didn't see you at all, Miss! Why, I was so frightened! (She draws several deep
breaths, places the tray beside the candle on the white cloth of the sofa table,
and begins to arrange the cups.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (as before). Why in the
world are you frightened? You see, don't you, that I am attending to the
chandelier, am doing your work again?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (busy at the table). Expect a
person not to get scared, when all of a sudden a voice like that comes out of
the dark, when, on top of it all, a dead man's in the house. As a rule I'm not
afraid, but I won't dare to go to the back part of the house alone any more,
it's just as if Mr. Warkentin would turn up right before you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Stuff and nonsense, I
suppose you kept the candle burning the whole night in your room again? I am
likely to come and get your candle one of these days.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Why Miss Clara is afeared
herself. She won't go a step without a light. Ain't it true, Miss Clara, you're
a little afeared too. You only won't let on.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I shall afear your back
before long! I have closed the eyes of many in my day. That's nothing new to me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (interested). But all of a sudden,
like Mr. Warkentin?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. When they get to be about
seventy, one knows how it goes, old widower Fritz in Kobieken went that way too.
Fell over and was gone, it's the best kind of a death. That comes just as it
comes.... Have you arranged the cups?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Everything in order. (Counting.)
The young master, the lady (correcting herself), no, the lady on the sofa and
the young master here (points to a chair), Miss Clara here and the fourth cup
... I suppose some one else is coming with the young master?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Yes, and don't ask so many
questions! Come here and hold the light, I want to light the chandelier.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (comes with the candle). Light the
chandelier? Why, it's almost daytime.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Do as I say. When the young
master arrives, it will still be dark.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (hands the candle up to her).
Wonder whether the young master'll stay long?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (has lighted the lights of
the chandelier, one after another). Wait and see. (About to get down.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (extends her hand to her). Now
don't you fall, Miss!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (gets down from the chair
carefully). Now then!... One does realize, after all, that the years are coming
on! When I was of your age, I jumped from the straw stack. You girls of today!
you have no sap, no vim! A girl as strong as a bear, and afraid of going to
pieces.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (admiring the chandelier). Oh my,
but now it's beautiful, Miss Clara! The young master will be pleased when he
comes.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> stands before the
chandelier with folded hands, engrossed in thought. The hall is now brightly
illumined. Only the remotest corners remain in a shadow.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> (comes in again from
the right with a lighted lantern, stops in astonishment). The deuce, Miss Clara!
You're up to the business. I do say, the world must come to an end, in grand
style! (He puts down the lantern beside the fireplace.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Anything else to do, Miss?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (absent-minded). You may go
now. If I need you I'll call.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (departing). All right, Miss, the
water's been put on for the coffee. (Goes off to the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. I was out on the
road. Miss. Not a sound yet.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (starts from her dreams and
points to the chandelier). For ten years it has not been lighted, Zindel! Ever
since Paul has been gone!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> (approaching from the
fireplace, mysteriously). Do you know, Miss Clara?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (with a start). Goodness!...
What is it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. I say, Miss Clara?
You'll put in a good word for me with the young master? A fellow does want to
know where he's at.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Yes, yes. (Listens toward
the outside.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. Especially now that
the old master is dead, and the young master doesn't know about things, all of
the work is on a fellow's shoulders, you see.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (still listening). Don't you
hear something, Zindel? It seems to me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> (is startled and
listens also). Where, pray tell?... </p>
<p class="right">[Brief silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (taking her hand from her
ear). No, nothing. It only seemed to me....</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. Heavens, Miss
Clara!... Where was it&#8212;? (He walks up and down restlessly.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (has sat down in a chair at
the table before the sofa). Now they may be here at any time. What time is it,
Zindel?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. Almost seven. Miss.
The Berlin train arrives at ten minutes after six.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. You were outside, Zindel,
weren't you; didn't you hear a carriage on the road?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> (warms his hands at
the fireplace). The wind's from the other way, Miss. One can hear nothing. And
it's cold as the deuce! They'll be nice and cold on the way.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I do not know how it comes,
but the day seems unwilling to break this morning. How does it look outside?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. Dark, pitch dark. Not
a star, nothing. Only over toward the Sobbowitz woods, it's beginning to dawn a
bit.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (yawning). Of course, that's
where the sun must rise.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> (also yawning). We'll
not get much of a peep at it today. It's going to be a gloomy day.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Possibly it will snow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. May be, why it's
time. Christmas without snow, I can't remember such a thing for the last few
years.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. No night has ever turned
out as long as the present one for me. I haven't closed an eye. I heard the
clock strike every time. And all the things that I saw and heard!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. (approaching again).
Don't tell it, Miss!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I continually saw the dead
man, but he was alive and opened the door and came toward me. And yet I knew he
was dead. And when I was about to scream, the clock struck and all was gone.</p>
<p class="hang2">[Outside a clock strikes. It has the silvery sound of old
chimes. Both are startled.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. Thunderation! You can
put it over a fellow. (He goes back to the fireplace.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (counts the strokes, first
in an undertone, then louder, and meanwhile rises). Five ... six ... seven ...
It has struck seven, Zindel. They will surely be here any moment. (She listens
again.) I believe I hear something now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> (at the fireplace,
seizes the lantern). Here they are. You can hear the carriage on the road.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (busily). After all they
came sooner than we expected! Hurry, Zindel, they are driving up now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> (already at the door
on the right, swinging the lantern). This minute, Miss Clara ...!</p>
<p class="right">[Goes off.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (also on the way to the
door, stops a moment and folds her hands). If he really <i>is</i> here, praise
and thanks to God!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (appears in the door at the
right). They are coming, Miss Clara, they are coming!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (busy again). Why are you
still there? Out with you and help the guests take off their wraps!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Why, I'm doing that very thing,
Miss!</p>
<p class="right">[Goes off.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (calling after her). And
keep the coffee in readiness, when I ring.</p>
<p class="hang2">[She also goes out at the right, leaves the door slightly open
behind her. Voices are heard outside. Brief silence. Then the door is opened
wide. <span class="sc">Paul</span>, <span class="sc">Hella</span>, <span class="sc">
von Glyszinski</span>, <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>
        appear in the door. <span class="sc">Paul</span> has taken off his coat
and hat outside.
        <span class="sc">Hella</span> wears a fur coat and toque. <span class="sc">
Glyszinski</span> wears a hat and heavy winter overcoat, turned up over his
ears.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> Well, if it's all right with
you, I prefer to go to my room for the present.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. As you please. Aunt Clara will
show you the way upstairs. Won't you, Auntie?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Yes, I'll be glad to show
the gentleman up.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (smiling). Or aren't the
guest-rooms upstairs any more?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (reproachfully). Why, my
boy, we should certainly not think of changing the rooms around. They are very
satisfactory and then they've been there so long.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (as before). Why, of course. They
have been there so long!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Shall we go?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (places her hand on <span class="sc">
Paul's</span>  shoulder). You will find, Paul, everything here is pretty much as
of old. Just make yourself comfortable! I shall be back directly. (To <span class="sc">
Glyszinski</span>. ) Please, will you come this way? (She points toward the
outside. The two go out. The door is closed behind them.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (who, until now, has not faced the
hall, remains standing in astonishment). Well, the chandelier in full splendor.
(Meditating.) The old chandelier. Heavens, how sacred it was to me when I was a
boy. It was fine of Aunt Clara to light the chandelier.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (meanwhile has slowly walked
through the hall, scrutinizing various things, sits down on the arm of a chair
near the sofa, still wearing her cloak and toque and keeping her muff in her
hand as if she were on the point of departing again at once. She smiles a trifle
sarcastically). Yes, for a bright morning, the chandelier suggests this, that
and what not.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (fixing his eyes upon her calmly).
To me the morning seemed pretty dark, as we were riding along. Didn't it to you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Oh yes, you are right. It was
even disagreeably dark. I kept on fearing we should fall into the ditch. I don't
like to ride in a strange region by night.</p>
<p class="right">[Brief silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (facing <span class="sc">Hella</span>,
shaking his head). I do not see what objections you can have to the chandelier.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (meeting his eye calmly). None
whatever, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Aunt Clara's intentions were
certainly good. One does realize that one was expected. (He turns away and takes
several steps through the hall.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. But you know that I do not like
such occasions. That is simply my disposition. I cannot make myself over.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I certainly do not demand that.
(Turns on his heel and approaches again.) Or have I not always allowed you to
have your own way!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (also compromising). Certainly,
certainly, up to the present we
<i>have</i> agreed on this point.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And shall continue in the future.
(He extends his right hand to
<span class="sc">Hella</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (grasps his hand and looks into
his face squarely). I am true to my old self, Paul, remain so too.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Simply because each one of us has
freely gone his own way, nothing has been able to separate us. That is the
reason why we have kept together so firmly, all of these years. Don't you think
so too?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. It seems to me that I held that
point of view long before we were acquainted.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (seriously) Rather say, with that
point of view, we found each other. For this point of view, I sacrificed my
home, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, therefore it surprises me
all the more, that you suddenly seem to be forgetting all about that ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. In what respect?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (continuing). That you behave
like a school boy who is coining home for his vacation.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (is silent for a moment, then
continues). Hella!... My father is lying there on his bier. (He points toward
the right.) I did not see him again!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Was it your fault? He forbade
you his house! This house!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (without listening to her). I have
not been able to come to an understanding with him. I shall never come to an
understanding with him! Do you realize what that means? (He turns away.)</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Hella</span> shrugs her shoulders and remains
silent. Pause.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has walked through the hall with
heavy steps, then becomes composed and speaks in a more unconcerned manner).
Will you take off your things, Hella? (rises, wavering). I don't know, I am
cold.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (near her). But how can you be
cold. The fire is roaring in the fireplace. Our good aunt has made such perfect
preparations. Who knows when she got up in order that we might be comfortable.
(He goes to the fireplace and throws wood into it.) (leaning on the chair,
taciturnly). It is probably due to the night ride.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (approaches her). Well, come
along! I'll help you!... You will surely not remain in your furs. (He helps her.
She takes off her hat and cloak and goes to the fireplace not without
hesitation.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (following her with his eyes,
gloomily). You are acting as if you preferred to leave again at once? (turning
fully toward him). Frankly, Paul, that is what I should like to do.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (flaring up). Hella! (Calm again,
coldly.) I simply do not understand you! (has sat down at the fireplace, holds
her feet up to the fire). I do not understand you, and you do not understand me!
That is as broad as it is long.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (shrugging his shoulders). I don't
know how you can think of going away under the present circumstances.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Quite simple. I do not demand
that you shall go with me. You can remain here as long as you are needed, order
your affairs, look about for a purchaser of the estate, and when good luck
favors you in finding him, you can come on. For the present I may as well
precede you to Berlin. You know that editing cannot be put off, the next number
must be out in a week. <i>Both</i> of us <i>can</i> not be absent. At least <i>I</i>
am indispensable.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And for this purpose you made a
trip of eight hours from Berlin to this place? Hella! (He places his hand on her
shoulder.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, this unfortunate trip!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with a deep breath). Unfortunate
trip, yes indeed!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. For I must tell you, Paul ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I have a feeling that I am not
quite suited to this place.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (bitterly). Aha! That is at the
bottom of this insistence about the new number of <i>Women's Rights</i>, which
is all but complete even now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (unswervingly). I have a feeling
that I am not adapted to this environment, and my feelings have rarely deceived
me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Oh, your feelings, Hella! Your
feelings! If you had only followed them solely, many matters would stand better
today! Believe me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I follow my feelings entirely
too much, or I should have remained in Berlin and should not sit here in the
presence of peasants where I have nothing at stake.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. But I have, Hella! I have very
much at stake here. After all a man does not abandon his inheritance point
blank. Do not forget that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>  (straightening up). Of what
concern is that to me! Sell it, why don't you! It's nothing but a dead weight to
you anyhow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why, I agree with you, Hella. And
I am in favor of selling the estate. But not today nor tomorrow. Such things
call for deliberation.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. But I simply cannot wait that
long. Just confess it, Paul, my place is in the world. You surely don't expect
me to desert my post. Our whole cause is hazarded, if I throw up the game now.
Particularly at this moment. You are demanding too much!... Do you expect me to
give up my life work, simply because you cannot break away from your clod, on
account of a stupid loyalty?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (controlling himself). It seems to
me, Hella, that we have a career <i>in common</i>. You are acting as if you
alone had a career.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. We have had, up to this day. You
are the one who is retreating! Not I!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (becoming excited). Hella! You
have been my friend! My comrade in stress and tribulation, I may say. We have
builded our life on our own resources, our new life, when the old life had
renounced us. We have stood together in the combat, for ten years! Are you
willing to forget that now? (Has stepped up to her and seized both of her
hands.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (tries to disengage herself).
Goodness, Paul ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (fixing his eyes upon her). For
years you have come to me with your wishes. Now I am coming to you! Now your
friendship is to assert itself. Answer me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (convinced against her will, is
forced to smile). Do not fall into tragedy, Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (unswervingly). You are to tell me
whether you can leave me alone at this time, whether you can bring yourself to
that point. Only a word!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Am I not here? What else do you
expect? And I shall remain here. At least for the immediate present.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (shaking her hands vigorously).
Oh, then all will turn out well! You will remain here! Thank you for that!
(Breaking out in joy.) Now everything may turn out well after all. (He walks to
and fro in suppressed excitement.) Mad as it may sound, Hella, under these
circumstances. (He stops, facing her.) I am almost merry! (He continues to pace
up and down.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (scrutinizes him and shakes her
head). Paul! Paul! Childishness! From one extreme to the other! When will you
come to reason. Take an example in me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (stopping in the centre of the
hall, sweeping his hand around). Hella!... This is the soil which nurtured my
youth. Do you expect me not be happy?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (enters again from the
right. She has taken off her head-cloth and wears a black dress). Now then,
Paul, here I am again. Have you made yourself at home? Is it warm enough in the
hall for both of you? You probably got good and cold on the way. You had the
wind to face, didn't you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (reflecting). Yes, pretty much! I
think it was from the east.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. It did take me rather a
long while, didn't it, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You probably had some other
matters that required attention? (Now that she stands directly before him he
looks at her more closely.) And how Aunt Clara has dressed up! (He shakes his
finger at her.) Well, well, Auntie. Still so vain, in your years?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why, Paul, this old dress!
(She strokes her skirt with her hands.) I have worn it so many years. Don't you
remember at all?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, yes, now ... (Meditates a
moment.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I was wearing it when your
mother died. That is the time I had it made.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (abruptly). Oh yes. That has been
a long time, to be sure!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. In waiting for you, I had
quite forgotten that I still had on my morning dress. So I quickly put on
something else.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. That is exactly what I intend to
do, dear Miss Clara. (She approaches the two.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, Auntie, you see, I don't
even know where you have quartered us? Possibly you would show Hella ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Right next door, dear Mrs.
... Mrs. &#8212;&#8212; Doctor!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (nodding to her to desist). Well
then, please do not go to any trouble.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (to <span class="sc">Hella</span>,
who has picked up her things). May I relieve you of something? Or can I help you
in any other way? Unlock the trunk, for instance?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (refusing). Do drop these
courtesies, Paul! That kind of thing is certainly not in vogue with us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (curtly). As you please!</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Hella</span> goes out with her things through
the open door on the left, closing it behind her.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (to <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>,
who has been listening in amazement). So you have lodged us next door?
(Hesitating as he points to the right.) Over there, I suppose ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (nodding). Yes, over there,
Paul, there ... the body lies.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (gloomily). Shall we not go in.
Aunt Clara?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why, not at once, my boy!
You certainly must have something to eat first! Refresh yourself a little. I'll
just call Lene, and have her bring the coffee! (Starts for the bell-pull.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (restraining her). I think we had
better wait until Hella and the gentleman are ready.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (looking at him tenderly).
Now you're not <i>cold</i> at all, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (significantly). No, Auntie, I am
not cold here. (With less constraint.) Just look at the fine fire in the
fireplace, how it flickers and crackles! I believe it too is glad that I am here
again. But who is gladdest of all, well, Auntie, just guess who that may be?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (shaking her head). Why, I
can't know that. I can't guess any more with this old head of mine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (slyly). <i>That</i> she doesn't
know! Oh Auntie, Auntie! Why, you yourself, you good old soul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (unaffectedly). I did light
the chandelier for you, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Of course, the chandelier! Do you
suppose I did not notice that you were at the bottom of that, Auntie? Come give
me your hand; thank you very much, Auntie!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (putting her arms around
him). I'm going to give you a kiss, my boy. Your wife will take no offense at
that. (She kisses him.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Oh my wife! That needn't ... (He
gently disengages himself from his aunt's embrace and goes to and fro
meditating.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (following him with her
eyes). Do you still remember, Paul, how I would hold you on my knees and rock
you when you were a little fellow?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (paces to and fro again). Yes,
yes, how all of that comes back again! How it is resurrected from its sleep!...
(He sits down before the fireplace in deep thought and stares into the fire.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (also goes to the
fireplace). Right there, where you are sitting now, my boy, you often read fairy
tales to me, about Snow-White and Cinderella and about the wolf and the old
grandmother ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (dreaming). Fairy tales, yes
indeed!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. You sat here, and I here,
and you held up your fairy tale book and acted as if you were grown up ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (smiling). I suppose that's the
way one felt too!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. And papa and mamma were out
in society or in the city ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, quite so, that's it. For, on
the whole, as I remember, I was not in this hall frequently. There was always a
little fear mixed up with it. Quite natural! The pictures, the spaciousness, the
emptiness and all that! Later that did disappear. The last time that I was in
this room, when may it have been ...? (He leans his head on his hand in
meditation.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. It was Christmas Eve, ten
years ago, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Christmas Eve ten years ago! You
may be right. I remember it was a short time before I had ... the crash with
father. I had come home at Christmas just because I imagined that that was the
best time to come to an understanding with father about all of those matters, my
future and other affairs, and I also recall that I wanted to allow the holidays
to pass before I dared to come out with my projects, the founding of my journal
and my marriage and all the beautiful surprises! Oh it was postponed as long as
possible. One did have an inkling of what it would lead to. Of course no one had
an idea how it would
<i>really</i> turn out!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. No, Paul, no one had an
idea that that would be the last Christmas Eve that we should celebrate
together. Your father least of all. All of us were as merry as ever. There stood
the tree and the chandelier was lighted ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Correct, correct! And Antoinette
... wasn't Antoinette present too? Why of course? That's what complicated the
matter so terribly for me. There she sits, my father has invited her, I know
that he intends her for me, I am to marry her, I'm to become engaged to her
right under the Christmas-tree, as nearly as I can tell. The word is expected
from me. All of you are waiting, and I ... why I simply can't. I simply
<i>cannot</i>, because I have forged quite different plans for my future,
because I too have obligations, in short, simply because it is impossible. (He
gets up in excitement.) Because it <i>was</i> impossible, Aunt Clara! Because I
imagined I could not stand it in the country, was destined for something better
than a sturdy estate owner and family father, simply because Hella was putting
such bees in my bonnet and because, in my stupidity, I believed it all! Just as
if the world had been waiting for me to come and set it right! Ridiculous! But
at that time I was convinced of it. At that time I had to make a clean breast of
it or it would have cost me my life. But, oh, how I <i>did</i> suffer in those
days!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. If you had only told me
about it, Paul! But I didn't know a thing about it. Not until it was too late
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (breathing deeply). Yes, then it
came quickly. I could not conceal it any longer. It simply burst forth. It can
have been only a few days later ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Three days, my boy ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Three days, yes, very likely. To
me, to be sure, they seemed like eternity. And strangely enough: terrible as the
clash with father was, when he found out what intentions I had and that I did
not want to remain with him and marry Antoinette and take over the estate some
day. Believe me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>, it was a relief in a sense,
after all, when it had been said, and father had forbidden me the house and I
sat in the carriage and drove away and was free for good. Yes for good! That is
what I made myself believe at the time and I fairly breathed with relief and
imbibed the crisp air! That must have been approximately this time of the year.
Why, certainly! Just about. It was at Christmas.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Third holiday is when it
was, Paul. I can still see you get into the carriage. It gave me such a shock. I
thought I'd fall over.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (caressing her). Good soul that
you are! Yes you always took my part ... (Interrupting himself.) Third holiday,
you say, it took place? (Striking his forehead.) Why that is today. Ten years
ago today!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. This very day!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (goes back and forth excitedly). I
say ... I say ... Ten years! Horrible!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. And you see, my boy, all
this time these candles have not been lighted! (She points to the chandelier.)
Just as they were put out on Christmas Eve, they are in their places today.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (gloomily). So that is why you
lighted the chandelier, Auntie?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Yes, now that you are here
again, it occurred to me that the candles ought to be lighted again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I think we shall let that
suffice. Broad daylight is already peering through the shutters. (He points to
the background where broad daylight comes in through the heart-shaped apertures
of the shutters, then slowly puts out the candles, one by one.) Now then, let us
put them out!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (goes to the background and
unscrews the shutters, opens them, letting the daylight stream in, and puts out
the lamp on the commode). Praise the Lord! After all it has become daylight once
more.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has put out the candles and looks
over at her). What do you mean by that. Aunt Clara?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (having opened the shutters,
comes forward again and whispers). I was forced to think so much, because it was
the first night that your father has been dead and has been lying there in the
corner room.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with suppressed feeling, after a
short struggle). Will you not tell me how father died?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Oh, Paul what is there to
tell about that? Didn't I telegraph to you? Heart failure, is what Doctor
Bodenstein said. He went to bed at ten o'clock that night, as always; it was
night before last, the first holiday.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Didn't he call at all? Did he not
succeed in making himself heard at all?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Not a word! From that time
on, no mortal heard another sound from him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (covers his face with his hands,
then hesitatingly). Do you think he still thought of me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. The departed thought of you
very often especially lately when thoughts of death were coming to him, I am
certain of that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And did he not want to see me
once more?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. He said nothing about that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Nothing, Aunt Clara? Nothing?
Think!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. He <i>said</i> nothing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (excited). But he <i>thought</i>
it. And did not have time to do it! Now he is taking it down into his grave with
him.</p>
<p class="right">[Pause.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I was going to ask you,
Paul ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Well? (He stands before her at
the fireplace.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. What kind of a man can that
be who came with you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Glyszinski?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why yes, the one I took up
stairs, the young man?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Heavens, he is a friend of ours.
Particularly of Hella.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Of your wife? Why, Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (smiling). Oh, Auntie! There is no
danger in him. You need not have any scruples about that. Hella indeed crams her
head with thoughts quite distinct from love. She never did suffer from that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. But to think that he just
came along? Did you invite him?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (shrugging his shoulders). Well,
what is a man to do? He lives with us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (more and more astonished).
He lives with you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. We keep house together, yes. And
so he wanted to come with us, and Hella was also of the opinion that we could
not exactly desert him. He is likely to do some fool thing. You know he is
always doing fool things ... It <i>wasn't</i> very agreeable to me, I must
confess. But it
<i>would</i> not do to leave him at home. When Hella takes a thing like that
into her head ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Don't be offended, Paul, I
can't get that through my head ... Aren't you the master of your house?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (smiling). Master of my house?...
No, Auntie, Hella would never put up with that and on that point I am forced to
agree with her.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. The things that one does
get to hear in one's old age! I'm too dense for that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Well you see. Aunt Clara, these
are views that are not exactly understood in the country. One has to work up to
that gradually.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Are you really happy with
them, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why I have fought almost fifteen
years for these views! Surely a man will not do a thing like that without
serious consideration.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. So you held those very
views at the time when you had your quarrel with your father, who is now dead
and gone?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That's the very reason I went
away, Auntie. Do you understand now why it was impossible for me to remain?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. (after a short silence,
significantly). And do you sometimes still think of Antonie, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (meditating). Antoinette?... Oh
yes, sometimes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Now do be frank, Paul! Has
the thought never come to you that you would really like to have Antonie?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (absent-minded). Who? I have her?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why Paul? <i>You</i> have <i>
her</i> and <i>she</i> have <i>you</i>! Didn't you really care for each other a
bit?</p>

<p class="center"><a name="pix_130" href="#pixRef_130"><img src="images/pg130.png" alt="Max_Halbe"></a></p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (as before, supporting his head on
his hand). Do you think so? That is so long ago? Possibly. What do I know about
it? (He sits up.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. We were always in the habit
of saying they'll make a fine couple when they are big, you and Antonie.</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">Paul</span> (almost painfully). You see, Auntie, what mistakes
one can make. Nothing can be determined beforehand. But I almost think you are
right. I liked her quite well, once upon a time. Something like that begins to
dawn on me. A big, stupid, love-sick lubber. That's <i>me</i>. And <i>she</i>
... What was <i>she</i>? (With the suggestion of a smile.) A remarkably
beautiful, sweet young thing with ashy-blond braids. Yes, yes, something like
that dawns upon me. She did have splendid ashy-blond hair and dark eyes. (He
leans his head on his hand.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. How well you still remember
that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (collects himself again). Yes,
strange, as it comes to me now. But at that time, you know, when I came back as
a student, the aforesaid Christmas, it was all gone, as if obliterated, not a
trace of it left. Then my head was filled with things of quite another nature.
My home had become strange to me, that is it, Auntie. Hella was in my mind. For
that reason nothing could come of it, the match between Antoinette and me. (<span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>
enters from the right, followed by <span class="sc">Lene</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (remaining at the door). Shall I
bring the coffee. Miss Clara?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (has also stepped to the
door). Yes, and don't forget the pound-cake!... But no, wait, I'll get it
myself. Just a moment, Paul! (She motions to him and goes out at the right with <span class="sc">
Lene</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (has stepped to the center
of the room. He is faultlessly clad in a black suit, spick and span from top to
toe). Here I am! (He looks about.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (approaches <span class="sc">
Glyszinski</span>). Yes, here you are!... You have spent much time on your
toilet.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Why, not more than usual.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. To be sure! That's correct.
(Looking at him with a bitter senile.) Well it <i>did</i> pay for the trouble.
You are fit for a ball.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>(looks around again). Where
is your wife?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Also busy with her toilet. But
will surely be here directly. It doesn't take her half as long as it does you.
Meanwhile, sit down! (He invites him to sit down on a chair by the sofa.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (sits down on the chair at
the right of the sofa, keeping his eye on the door at the left.) Ah, here comes
madam! (He gets up to meet <span class="sc">Hella</span>, who is just entering
the door on the left, clad in a pleated blouse and a plain skirt.) May I conduct
you to the table, madam? (He offers her his arm.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (places her arm on his and looks
over at the table). Why, is it time?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (leads <span class="sc">
Hella</span> to the sofa). Please, here in the place of honor.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Is it absolutely required that I
should occupy the sofa? Will you not sit here, Paul? (She stands at the sofa
hesitating.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (with the tips of his
fingers placed together). Please, please, madam. You are to preside!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (walks through the hall with his
hands on his back and speaks over his shoulder). Don't be embarrassed!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I am not particularly in love
with this old uncomfortable furniture. I distinctly prefer a pretty modern
fauteuil. (She sits down).</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (comes in at the right with the
coffee service, places the tray containing the coffee-pot, cream-pitcher and
cake on the table between the cups. Addresses <span class="sc">Hella</span>).
Miss Clara will bring the pound-cake directly. Shall I fill the cups?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You may go. We shall attend to
that.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Lene</span> casts a curious glance at the
two, then at <span class="sc">Paul</span>, and goes out at the right.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>  (in an undertone to <span class="sc">
Glyszinski</span>). Seems to be a regular country hussy. Did you notice the
stupid expression?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (quoting with dignity). Upon
her brow the Lord did nail a brazen slab!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (to <span class="sc">Paul</span>,
who is still walking about). Paul, can't you stop that everlasting marching?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I find it agreeable after the
night's travel. Have you any objections?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, it makes me nervous,
especially here in this awful hall, where every step reverberates ten times
over, because you do not even have the proper carpets. Isn't there another room,
where one can sit with some comfort. (See pours out her coffee.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with restrained asperity). No,
not at present!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Then at least do me the favor to
sit down, your coffee is getting cold, anyhow. (She pours out <span class="sc">
Paul's</span>  coffee.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (approaching). Very well! I shall
sit down then.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (raising his cup). And I,
madam? Am I to have none?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (decisively). Have you forgotten
our household regulations, dear sir?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (grumbling). But he got
some, didn't he?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I have allowed an exception in
Paul's case today. Just take the pot and help yourself.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (shaking his head). Too bad!
Too bad! (He pours out his coffee.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (has entered from the right
carrying a platter with a large pound-cake). Children, here comes the
pound-cake! Fresh from the oven. It's fairly steaming still. (She cuts the
cake.) You surely haven't taken your coffee already?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (very courteously). You are
really going to too much trouble, dear Miss Clara.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Trouble, well, well. But
now do help yourself! (She puts a large piece of cake on each plate.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, (smiling). Do you know, Hella, I
do almost feel as I did as a schoolboy, when I came home for the Christmas
vacation. In those days we would also sit in the hall and over there the fire
would burn and the pound-cake would stand on the table exactly as today. Only
that my mother had done the baking.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (in the chair opposite the
fireplace). Now you must imagine:
<i>I</i> am your mother, Paul. (She has also poured out her coffee and begins to
drink it.) How do you like it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Just as much as in the old days.
It seems to me as if it were today.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Then eat away, my boy!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You have really had very good
luck with this pound-cake, my dear Miss Clara. Accept my compliments.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (consumes his piece with
great satisfaction). Delicious! A work of art!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You may well feel set up about
that, Auntie. Glyszinski knows all about cake.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Yes in such matters we
Poles are connoisseurs.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Their whole nourishment is made
up of desserts.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. I consider sweets a
thousand times more elegant than that brutal alcohol, which deadens all finer
instincts.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I suppose the gentleman was
also born in this region.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Yes, mademoiselle, I am a
Pole.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. A Pole, and attended the
gymnasium in Berlin!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Unfortunately I got away
too early. Nevertheless I shall remain what I always was.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Do you remember Laskowski,
Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. From Klonowken?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Yes, quite nearby! He owns
the neighboring estate.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why, of course! He is even a
relative in a sense. What makes you think of him. Aunt Clara?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. It just occurred to me,
simply because he is also a Polander and gets along with his German so well.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why, I even attended school with
him for a while. He <i>was</i> a fox if there ever was one.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (in a searching manner).
Aren't you glad, Paul, that your father held on to Ellernhof for you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. How so? Why?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. He might have sold the
estate to Laskowski or some one else.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (who has been leaning back and
playing the part of the silent but attentive listener, takes a hand). I cannot
see in what sense that would have been a misfortune.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. If Ellernhof had gone over into
the hands of strangers? You are simply judging from your point of view. Then I
should never have seen my childhood home again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (forcibly). But what are we to do
with it. We have it on our hands and can't help but be glad to get rid of it at
any price.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (with growing uneasiness, to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>). What is your wife saying? You intend to go away, intend to sell?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Why, certainly! As soon as
possible! What else is there for us to do?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. You intend to sell the
estate that has been in the family over two hundred years?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. That can be of no possible
advantage to us. Do you expect us to settle down here? Do you suppose I have the
least inclination to degenerate out here in the country?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. And you, Paul, what have
you to say to that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Paul fully agrees with me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (gets up, distressed). Don't
torment me with that now, good people, I beg of you. I am really not in the
proper mood. There is certainly no hurry about that matter.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Don't you realize that you
will commit a sin, if you sell the fine estate that your father maintained for
you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Oh sin! Sin! Do you not, from
your point of view, consider the manner in which Paul's father behaved toward us
a sin? I am unable to see any difference. There was no compunction about locking
the door upon us. I was treated as a nondescript, bringing disgrace to the
family! As if my family could not match up with the Warkentins any day! After
all, I am the daughter of a university professor, my dear Miss Clara. You
possibly fail to appreciate that a bit. Therefore I repeat to you, Paul hasn't
the slightest reason to be ashamed of me! And he hasn't been. But Paul's father <i>
was</i>. He forced us to earn our daily bread! And now that we have been
successful, now that we have won a place for ourselves, now they begin to think
of us, simply because they need us. Now they are becoming sentimental. No,
dearest! You did not concern yourselves about us! Now we shall not concern
ourselves about you! Now we shall simply pay it all back! That's the sin that
you were talking about. Ellernhof has no claims upon us, (She breathes deeply
and leans back on the sofa.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (has hung upon her lips,
enthusiastically). Madam, your hand! (He extends his hand.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (curtly). Oh do let us dispense
with that for the present, doctor!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has been listening from the
fireplace and now approaches). That is quite correct, Hella, but there is one
thing that you must not forget. I really did provoke my father at the time. I
was young and inexperienced. I felt compelled to tell him at the outset, even
before I went to the university, that I did not believe that I should be able to
endure life in the country later on.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. And the fact that he expected
you to marry any woman that suited
<i>him</i>; you don't seem to think of that at all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, yes, you are right ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Tell me, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, Auntie.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. What in the world have you
to do in Berlin that prevents you from staying here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Oh, Aunt Clara, that is a
difficult matter! I publish a journal.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. A journal? Hm!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. We publish a feminist journal
which we ourselves have founded and simply cannot desert.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (naïvely). Well is that so
very necessary, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. <i>Is</i> it necessary?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (dubiously). Oh Hella! (Shrugs his
shoulders.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes it is necessary. If <i>you</i>
are able to forget it, <i>I</i> am
<i>not</i>!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I shall not quarrel now, the hour
does not seem fitting to me. I want to go in. (He makes a significant gesture to
the right.) Would you care to go with me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You want to see him?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, I want to see him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (gets up and steps up to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>). Excuse me, Paul! I am really not in the frame of mind.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. As you think best.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You know very well that I spare
myself the sight of the dead, whenever I can. I did not even see <i>my</i>
father.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (has risen). I'll go with
you, my boy, brace up!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (nods to her, choking down his
words). I'm all right. (The two slowly go out at the right.) [Short silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (stands at the chair, clenches
her fist, stamps her foot, in a burst of passion). I cannot look at the man who
has forbidden me his house! Never!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (has also risen, steps up to <span class="sc">
Hella</span>). How I admired you, madam!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (still struggling). I cannot
bring myself to <i>that</i>!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (sentimentally). How you sat
there! How you spoke! Every word a blow! No evasion! No retreat! Mind triumphing
over matter! The first time I ever had this impression of you, Hella, do you
recall, the large meeting when you stood on the stage and your eye controlled
thousands? Then and there my soul rushed out to you! Now you possess it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (stands erect, resolutely and
deliberately). If I really possess your soul, dear doctor, listen to my request.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. I am your slave, command
me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. It concerns Paul. You see how
matters stand with him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (gloomily). Paul is not a
modern man. I knew that long ago.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Let us avoid all digressions
now! (With unflinching emphasis.) Paul <i>must</i> ... <i>not</i> ... <i>remain
here</i>! Do you understand?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. What can I do in the
matter?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (taps her finger on his chest).
You must help me get him away from here as soon as possible!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. And you would ask <i>me</i>
to do <i>that</i>?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Why shouldn't I?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Expect me to help
reestablish the bond between you? Don't be inhuman, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. But you surely realize the
relations that obtain between you and me, doctor. You are my co-worker, my
friend!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Is that all, Hella?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Why, do you demand more? Beyond
friendship I can give you nothing! No, it will be better for you to help me plan
how we can get him away most readily. Rather today than tomorrow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Even if I were willing; why
he pays no attention to me. Sometimes he strikes the pose of the man of thirty
and treats me like a schoolboy. If it were not for you, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (goes back and forth in intense
excitement). I see it coming! I see it coming! Irresistible! I have been
watching it for a year. Something is working on him. The old spirits have been
revived in him. They are restless to assert themselves. That calls for prompt
action. He must not remain here. He must absolutely not remain in this
atmosphere, which unsettles the mind, this funereal atmosphere. Oh! I can't
stand it! Come on, doctor, I must have some fresh air! Get my things!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. I am on the wing! (About to
start in some direction or other.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (restrains him). But no, wait a
moment! We can go right through our rooms. A door leads to the garden from
there. (She listens.) Isn't that Paul, now? Do you hear?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. It seems to be.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (hurriedly). Quickly! I do not
care to see him now! I don't want to hear about the dead man. I can't endure it.
Do hurry! (She draws him along out toward the left.)</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Paul</span> and <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>
come in again from the right. <span class="sc">Paul</span> walks slowly through
the hall with his head bowed. For a moment he remains standing before the chair
near the sofa, then suddenly sits down and presses his face into his hands. <span class="sc">
Aunt Clara</span> has slowly followed him, stands before him, and looks at him
lovingly and sadly. Brief silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (puts her hand on his head).
Compose yourself, Paul! What's the good of it! Your father is past all trouble.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (without raising his head). Yes,
he's beyond it all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. All of us may be glad when
we are that far along.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (between his teeth). When we are
that far along, yes, yes, Aunt Clara! When we are all through with it, this
incomprehensible, senseless force! (He leans back in the chair and folds his
hands over his head.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Your dead father enjoys the
best lot after all. It's not at all an occasion for weeping, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (nods his head mechanically). You
caught the meaning, Auntie.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I am old, my boy. I know
what is back of life. Nothing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You have caught the meaning.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. When you are as far along
as I am, you will think so too.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (throws his head back on his
chair, yielding to his pain). I am tired, Aunt Clara! Tired enough to die!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. That is due to the journey,
Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (repeats mechanically). That is
due to the journey. (Waking up.) You are right, Aunt Clara. To the long journey
and the long, long way.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Now you will take a rest,
my boy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That's what I should like to do,
Aunt Clara. Take a real rest after all of the wild years! And they do say the
best rest is to be found at home.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Do you see how good it is
for you to be at home again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (absorbed). How calmly he lay
there. How great and serene! Not the vestige of a doubt left! Everything
overcome. All the questions solved!... (Lamenting.) Father, father, if I were
only in your place! (He presses his head in his hands.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (worried). Paul, what's the
matter!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Nothing, Aunt Clara, it's over
now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. No, no, my boy, there's
something wrong with you. You needn't tell me. I know well enough.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (controlling himself). You know
nothing at all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. And you can't talk me out
of it. It's your wife. What I know, I know. Your wife is to blame! And if you <i>
do</i> say no ten times over!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (gets up, with a firm voice). I
repeat, Aunt Clara, you know nothing about it! I do not want to hear one word
about that, please remember. (With marked emphasis.) I do not want to hear of
it! (Walks up and down in excitement.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Paul, Paul, if you had only
taken Antonie!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (sits down in the chair at the
fireplace, restraining his pain). Be quiet, Aunt Clara!... Do you want to make
me even more miserable than I am?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (gets up, steps up to him
and lays her hand on his head). My poor, poor boy!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>ACT II</h2>

<p class="hang1">The forenoon of the following day. The gloomy light of a winter
day comes in through the wide windows at the background of the hall, as on the
day before. Outside, white bushes and trees loom up vaguely. A dark velvet cover
is spread over the sofa table now. A fire again biases in the fireplace.</p>

<p class="hang1">In front of it on the left sits <span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>
with his feet toward the fire and a book in his hand. He is again faultlessly
clad in a black suit; looks pale. At his right, in the center chair <span class="sc">
Hella</span> reposes comfortably. She likewise holds a book and looks as if she
had been reading. As on the previous day, her dress is dark, but not black.</p>

<br>
<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. These awful visits of condolence
all day yesterday! If calls of that kind continue today, I'll simply lock myself
in and fail to appear. Let Paul settle it as he may.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. And yet! How easily and
graciously you can dispose of the good people. I can't get over my astonishment.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes and then to feign a sadness
that one does not remotely feel, cannot feel! What an idea!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (after a moment of
reflection, whispering). Do you know what makes me glad?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (curtly). No, possibly you will
tell me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (halts a bit). That the dead
man is out of the house!... I suppose they took him to the church?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, quite early this morning.
The coffin is to be there till tomorrow. I suppose you were afraid?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>, Why you know that I
sometimes see things.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You modern creature, you! Look
at me! I <i>try</i> to see <i>things</i> by daylight. I can battle with <i>them</i>!
Not with the other kind.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Oh you don't realize how I
have envied you for that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Why don't you follow my example
then? Do not lose yourself deeper and deeper in your riddles. Enter the
conflict! Just as I do!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. You, Hella
...! I cannot vie with you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Don't be a weakling! Try it! You
are old enough.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (grumbling). <i>Too</i> old.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (more and more impassioned). Too
old! Ridiculous. When Paul was of your age he was already in the fray, founding
our <i>Women's Rights</i>. And I, I helped him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. You must have been of
firmer fiber than we of the younger generation.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (gets up, stands up straight,
folds her hands over her head). Possibly! I was scarcely twenty at the time, but
I felt strong enough to throw down the gauntlet to the whole world, when it was
a question of my rights. I had an uncontrollable thirst for freedom, and it is
not too much to assert that I gave Paul the incentive for all that followed.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. That's just like you,
Hella! I suppose he would simply have remained in his old trot if it had not
been for you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (supporting herself on the
chair). I should not go that far. He had already freed himself, but did not know
in what direction to move. He was still groping. He might have followed an
utterly wrong course, might have fooled away his time with literature and
impractical things like that. His rescue from all that was my work. I guided
him! You know he was a pupil of my father. When we became acquainted, I had no
difficulty in showering things upon him. You see I had spent my whole childhood
in this intellectual atmosphere. And he ... well, you can see from where he had
come. (She sweeps her hand around.) That is just why I was ahead of him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (lamenting). Why was I not
born ten years earlier? Then I should have found what he now has and fails to
value!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (walks through the hall slowly,
engrossed in memories). Yes it was a joyous time! All of us young, vigorous and
certain of victory! (Her manner becomes gloomy.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (has followed her with his
eyes). Are you so no longer, Hella?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (morosely). I?... (Collects
herself.) More than ever ... But I have become tired, Doctor!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (subdued). I do suppose it
requires more than mortal strength to hold out, in this fashion, a whole life
long.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (straightening up). Yes, if one
did not know that he is going to prevail, that he will carry out his demands;
one can rest assured only when he has the better arguments in his favor. Not
until then. (She steps to the background in great excitement.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (jumps up). Hella! Hella!...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (comes back again). Not an hour
before that, I tell you. Do you understand the terrible aspect of my present
position now? My nails fairly tingle. Whenever I hear the clock strike out
there, something seems to drive me away. Another hour gone, and life is so
short. It cries within me, go to your post, and I am forced to remain! I must
remain on account of Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (strikes his fist on the
chair). Oh he doesn't deserve to have you sacrifice yourself for him! If you
called me in this manner ... I should follow you to the scaffold!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (approaches him, in a changed
manner). What was your impression of Paul today, Doctor? Be frank!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (gloomily). Why do you ask <i>
me</i> about that? I scarcely caught sight of him before he rode away.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. It seemed to me that he was more
cheerful, freer. (To herself.) Possibly because the body was out of the house.
(She turns away again.)</p>

<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> steps to the background,
shaking his head, seems in a quandary.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (has paid no attention to him,
since her thoughts completely dominate her, speaks as if to herself). May be all
will turn out for the best after all. (She gains control of herself and looks
up.) Where in the world are you, Doctor? (She approaches him.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (stands at the window and
looks into the garden). I am watching the snow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I suppose you are surprised that
I am hopeful again?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Since I have been in your
company nothing surprises me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (continues). But Paul must listen
to reason. My position is clearly correct. You do not know him as I do. Paul is
tender-hearted; all that is necessary is to know how to deal with him. (She
reflects a moment and concludes.) Possibly I did not always know how to do that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (deprecatingly). Don't
belittle yourself, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. And there shall be a change. But
first of all he must get away from here. Of course we shall have to wait till
after the funeral. But then I shall not allow myself to be kept here any longer.
I'll get in and ride away and Paul will be forced to come along. When I once
have him in Berlin again ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. And the estate?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I'll simply sell that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (rushes up to her with
flaming eyes). Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (coldly). Well?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Are you going to leave
Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. How so? What is the matter with
you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (seizes her hand). Can't you
leave Paul! My life is at stake.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Dear friend, don't stake your
life so foolishly! And release my hand. I do not want to leave Paul! I haven't
the slightest reason to do so. We agree very well.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (drops his head). Then I was
mistaken, after all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, it seems so to me also. You
simply do not know what Paul has been to me. [Pause.] I want to go to work, I
still have much to do. The editorial work is crowding. (Takes several steps.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (enters from the right, clad in a
riding suit and riding boots, shakes of the snow and waves his hat vigorously as
he speaks). Good morning, you stay-at-homes! Just see how I look.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (has turned around at his
approach and looks at him). You are bringing winter in with you, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with dash). That's what I'm
doing. I'm bringing winter in with me. Regular country winter, with ice and
snow, such as the city knows only by hearsay. Don't you envy me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (surprised). How so? For what?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. For what, she asks! Why for all
the snow in which I have been stamping about! For this honest winter mood, that
I have not had for so many years!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Where in the world have you
been!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (sits down, facing the fire, and
crosses his legs). Far, far away, I can tell you.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> has risen from his chair
and has slowly walked over toward the left, where he sits down on the sofa and
pretends to become interested in a book.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. One can tell that. You are in a
beautiful condition.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (stares into the fire, spinning
away at his thoughts). I rode a great, great distance!... To the border of our
possessions!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Is that so very far?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Very far!... At least it seemed
so to me when I was a child.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, of course, to a child
everything seems larger.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. But this time it was no delusion!
It was really quite a distance. And I did remain away long enough too.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (sarcastically). Are you not
boasting, Paul? I believe you were riding around in a circle.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (waking up). And so I did. Criss
cross over the fields, taking ditches, helter skelter as it were, right through
the dense snow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (as before). <i>Can</i> you
really ride, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I? Well, I should say! I supposed
I had forgotten how, during all of these empty years, but when I had mounted,
for a moment I was unsteady, but only for a moment, then I felt my old power.
The bay realized that I still know how, and off we were like destruction itself.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (from the sofa). I should
like to try it myself sometime.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (without heeding him). And
curiously enough Hella, strange as the way had naturally become to me, I
nevertheless got along easily. After all, one does not forget the things with
which one has once been familiar, and, you see, my father took me with him often
enough in my boyhood. (Smiling.) Possibly in order that, some day in the future,
I might get my bearings in the old fields! At last I got into the forest and
when I was out of that, I saw the houses of Klonowken, all covered with snow ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (has listened very attentively,
interrupts). Klonowken, you say! Isn't that the estate where&#8212;what is his
name?&#8212;your relative lives?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. <span class="sc">Laskowski</span>,
you mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Quite right, <span class="sc">
Laskowski</span> ... But you did not call on him, did you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. No, then I came back.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. The ride has certainly agreed
with you. Your color is much better than yesterday.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (joyously). <i>Is</i> it?... Well
that is just the way I feel.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Then you can see more clearly
today, what you wish to do and what is necessary?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Much more clearly, Hella! As I
trotted along in the snowstorm, many things dawned upon me. My head has became
clear, Hella.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I am glad for you and both of
us!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (seizes her hand). Yes, for both
of us. We must come to an agreement, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (cautiously). I hope we are
agreed. And, moreover, you know how we can remain so!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (thoughtful again). Well, as I
rode along, strange! So many years of desk work, I thought to myself, and
nothing but desk work. My bones have almost become stiff as a result and, after
all, what has come of it? Little enough! You surely must admit that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>  (seriously). I can <i>not</i>
admit that, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. But we do live in a continual
turmoil, Hella, in an everlasting struggle the outcome of which we can not
foresee and <i>from</i> which we shall reap no rewards. We are working for
strangers, are sacrificing our best years and have forgotten to consider
ourselves. Do you suppose they will thank us some day when we are down and out?
Not a soul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Nor do I demand gratitude and
recognition. I do what I have recognized to be correct; that constitutes my
happiness.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. But not mine. I want more, Hella!
I am at an age when fine words no longer avail me. And see, here is a world in
which I have what I need, what I am seeking, here at last I can follow myself
up, can see what is really in me and not what has merely been imposed upon me. I
am on the crest of my life, Hella. Possibly past it. Do not take it amiss! I
need rest, composure ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (reserved). And for that you are
going to the end of the world?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I had got to the end of the
world! Now I shall begin all over again. Would the attempt not be worth while?
Tell me, comrade! (He seizes both of <span class="sc">Hella's</span>  hands and
looks squarely into her eyes.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (reserved). I can't answer you
now, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (visibly relieved). Very well! If
you can not at present ... There is plenty of time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Isn't there? You will give me
time. I should like to put it off only a few days longer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (joyously). Why as long as you
please. Till then I shall be assured of you and meanwhile you will get
acclimated?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Only a few days, Paul. Possibly
I can make a definite proposition to you by that time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (shakes her hands again, happy).
Hella, my clever, unusual Hella! (He puts his arms around her waist, about to
kiss her.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with quick resistance). What are
you doing, Paul! Don't you see how wet you are?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Snow-water! Clear snow-water.
What harm will that do! Give me a kiss, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (reluctantly). You <i>do</i> have
notions at times!... So here is your kiss! (Extends her cheek to him.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (embraces her.) Oh, no! Today I
must have something unusual! (He tries to kiss her mouth.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (warding him off). Do stop that,
Paul! I beg you urgently!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looks into her eyes). But why
not, Hella! Just for today ...! (His voice is soft and pleading.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with her face toward the sofa).
Why Glyszinski is sitting there.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (impatiently). What is Glyszinski
to me? It's <i>surely</i> all right for a husband and wife to kiss each other.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. But not before strangers! I
can't bear that, Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (bitterly). Calm down! It never
happens anyhow! (He releases her and walks through the hall with great strides).</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (shrugging her shoulders).
Because it is really not proper for two people who are as old as we have become.
People should become sensible sometime.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with increasing excitement). You
always were! Why, I don't know you any other way.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You must have liked it well
enough.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (bursting out). Yes I probably did
...! At that time! Because I was a fool!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (picks up her book again, turns
as if to go away). Now you are becoming abusive! Good-by, I have work to do!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (intercepts her). Hella! I am
coming to you with an overflowing heart! I have a yearning to be alone with you,
once, only once; I am almost desperate for a heart to heart talk ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (who has silently followed
the scene from the sofa, presumably engrossed in his book, but at times has cast
over a furtive glance, makes a motion as if to rise). If I'm disturbing you, you
only need to say so ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Do not be funny, doctor. You do
know that I wanted to go to my room some time ago. Please let me pass, Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has retreated, with an angry
bow). You have plenty of room! (Across to <span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>)
Hella is quite right. There is no longer any occasion for you to go. (He goes to
the fireplace and sits down facing the fire.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (remains in the centre of the
hall a few moments longer, then takes a step in the direction of <span class="sc">
Paul</span>, and speaks in a changed, gentler voice). Paul! (<span class="sc">Paul</span>
does not stir).</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (urgently). Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That's all right!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Oh, is it! Very well! (She turns
away abruptly, goes over toward the right, opens the door and turns around,
saying curtly). I wish to work, so please do not disturb me. (She goes out.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has become restless, gets up and
calls). Hella! (One can hear how the door is being locked on the other side.) As
you please, then! (He sits down again).</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (looking up from his book).
Hella has locked the door.</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Paul</span> sets his teeth and is silent.
Pause.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Am I disturbing you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (without turning around). I have
already told you,
<i>no</i>! Not any longer, now!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. So I <i>have</i> been
disturbing you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I'll leave that to <i>you</i>.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. You would like to have me
go away?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Dear Glyszinski, <i>don't</i> ask
such stupid questions!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Well, I <i>should</i> have
gone long ago ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (cutting). Indeed?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. I can see very well how
irksome I am to you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You are not at all irksome, dear
Glyszinski, neither now nor formerly. You are only funny.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. You two admitted me to your
household.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Excuse me! <i>Hella</i> admitted
you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. That is what I was going to
say. Upon Hella's express invitation ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Correct.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Indeed I may say upon her
wish ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Also correct.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. I came into your house.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That was very kind of you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. And so I can leave it only
upon her invitation. Not before! I should be offending Hella, and that I cannot
take upon myself. I revere her too much for that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (cutting). Sensitive soul that you
are!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Of course my views may not
agree with all the conventional rules of society, but there are still other,
higher duties.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (amused). And <i>you</i> honor
them?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (casting a piercing look at <span class="sc">
Paul</span>). Yes, it is my duty to protect Hella.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Protect Hella?... (He gets up.)
Do you know! One is impelled to feel sorry for you! (He turns away and walks
through the hall.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Well!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, you have no idea how far you
are off the track. That's the reason.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Thanks for your sympathy!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You are badly off the track, and
will hardly get on again, unless you are warned in time. Whether or not that
will do you any good, is your affair.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (agitated). But what does
all of this mean? I don't understand you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (very seriously). In a word, that
means: look out for women who are like Hella! Look out for that ilk! That tells
the whole story! The whole story!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (jumps up). And you expect
me to follow that advice?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Do not follow it, but don't be
surprised later on if you find yourself in the position in which I am today. It
has taken me ten to twelve years to arrive at it. Half of that time will suffice
for you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Why that is sheer nonsense!
Your position is estimable enough.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I am a bankrupt! That's all!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (greatly excited).
Imagination, pure imagination! You have your position! You have a name in the
movement!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (bitterly). Oh yes! This movement!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. I wish I were that far
along!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Possibly you are, without knowing
it. But as for myself, when I was of your age and began to fly the track, the
aforesaid <i>track</i>, I was quite another fellow! Today as I rode through the
snow knee-deep, that became quite clear to me! I saw myself as I had been once
upon a time and then realized what had later become of me! All the strength! All
the life! All the color! All lost! All gone!... Colorless and commonplace! That
is the outcome! (He sinks down in complete collapse.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (very uncomfortably). And
you blame Hella for all that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (a pen behind her ear, puts in
her head and calls). Glyszinski! Doctor! Why don't you come in! I want you to
help me write a number of letters. I shall dictate to you. (Withdraws again.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (with precipitation).
Immediately, madam. (He runs to the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (raising his finger). You have
been warned!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (already at the door on the
right). Some other time! I have no time now!</p>

<p class="hang1">      [Goes off, the door closes again and is bolted on the
other side.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looks after him, then, after a
pause). He is going the same course! (Takes a few steps through the hall,
remains standing before the portraits on the wall, looks up at them for a long
while, breathes deeply and says, only just audibly): The Warkentins bring no
luck!... And they <i>have</i> no luck!...</p>
<p class="hang2">[He steps across to the spinet which is open, sits down, and
softly strikes a number of chords. <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> comes in
quickly from the right, looks around.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (sitting at the spinet). Well,
Aunt Clara? (He lowers his hands from the keys.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (cautiously). It is well
that you are here, my boy! (She approaches.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (absent-minded). Is there
anything?...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (shaking her head). Why a
person can't talk to your wife. And that young man ... There's something about
him too. Where in the world are the two now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (feigning indifference). There, in
the other room, Aunt Clara.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Do you suppose she will
hear us?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Oh no, Auntie! They are in the
green room. The sun-parlor lies between. And then ... when Hella is working, she
doesn't hear anyhow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Those two! I do say! They
just have to stay together the whole day! But I was going to say ... Laskowskis
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. What about Laskowski?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Wonder whether we ought to
send them an announcement?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I don't care! Although I do not
exactly consider it necessary.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Just on account of the
wife.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Whose wife?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Well, Mrs. Laskowski. Why,
don't you know?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (turns around). Not a thing! Is
Laskowski married?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why, Paul! Didn't he marry
Antonie?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (recoils). Antoinette ...? Our
Antoinette? And I am just finding out about that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Well, I didn't know whether
you cared to hear anything about Antonie.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (approaches her and speaks to her
in an interested manner). Why, Auntie, one <i>is</i> interested in the people
who were once near and dear.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Then, you didn't ask about
her yesterday!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Goodness, Aunt Clara! I didn't <i>
want</i> to ask!... After all, I'm finding out soon enough!... Poor
Antoinette!... Wasn't she able to find any one else?...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. You had been gone a year
and a half, Paul, and then they got married.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (depressed). Well, well ...! That
long ago? Then it has really ceased to be news! How <i>does</i> she look?
(Bitterly.) I suppose quite ...? (He makes a significant derogatory gesture.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Don't say that, Paul! She
can vie with the youngest and most beautiful of them! She is in her very prime
now! Just set her over against your wife!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (embarrassed). Well, well! Hella
is not exactly obliged to conceal herself, it seems to me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (eagerly). But oh, you
should see Mrs. Laskowski!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (crabbed). Well, then old
Laskowski may thank his stars. How in all the world did Antoinette run into that
fellow? I could never
<i>bear</i> him!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Have you forgotten <i>every</i>
thing Paul? Why, he was forever after her, even when you were still here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why, he is the greatest crook on
God's green earth!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. At first Antonie didn't
care a thing in the world for him, but later she took him just the same, when it
was all over with you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (disdainfully). Of course he had
his eye on her estate, the sly rogue! I'd vouch for that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (gleefully). Her estate,
Grosz-Rukkoschin, went to him right at her marriage. You know that belongs to
her from her father's side.
<i>You</i> might have that now, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (interested). Well, and how do the
two get along? He and Antoinette?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (shrugging her shoulders).
Oh, Paul, what do I know about it? They have no children.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (relieved). They haven't any
children either? Well!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. They did have one, a girl!
But they lost her.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Lost her ... Well, well!... Hm!
Antoinette!... Antoinette Rousselle as Mrs. von Laskowski!... Could I have
dreamed such a thing when I was a sophomore with old Heliodor! (He shakes his
head, burdened with memories, then with a sudden change.) Well, of course, we
shall send the Laskowskis an announcement. We'll attend to that at once! (Starts
to go.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (holds him by the arm).
Never mind, Paul! I <i>have</i> sent it. Yesterday. I was certain it would be
all right with you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (forced to smile). Well, what do
you think of Aunt Clara!...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. It's only on account of the
neighbors. Now that you are here and they live right next to us, if we should
not even invite them to the funeral....</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (absent-minded). Yes, yes, quite
right!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (searchingly). For you'll
have to observe a bit of neighborliness with the estate-owners around here, my
boy ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (warding off). Oh, Aunt Clara,
here's the same old question again!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Now really, Paul, don't you
know yet what you are going to do, whether you intend to remain?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (very seriously). Aunt Clara! I
shall <i>never</i> be able to induce Hella. That is becoming clearer and clearer
to me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (bolt upright). If Ellernhof
is sold, I shall not survive it! I have been here thirty-three years! I have
carried you all in my arms, you and your brothers and sisters. All of the rest
are dead. You are still here, Paul. I closed your mother's eyes for her. I
witnessed the death of your father. In all of my days I have known only
Ellernhof. At the cemetery I've selected a place for myself where all of them
are lying. Shall I go away now at the very end? At least, wait until I am dead!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (passionately). Don't make it so
desperately hard for me, Aunt Clara!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (looking at the walls). Here
they all hang on the walls, those who were once active here ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, (follows her eyes). Do you hear?
The door-bell. (The door-hell rings.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Callers.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Callers! Again!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Probably to express their
condolences.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (impatiently). Just at the most
inopportune moment!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (listening). I shouldn't be
surprised if the Laskowskis were coming!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (giving a start). Antoinette ...?
Why, that ...! And I in my riding boots! Do see who it is!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why, of course it is! I can
hear him from here ... Shall I bring them in, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, Can't we take them somewhere
else?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Where, pray tell? (She goes
to the door on the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (goes to the door on the left,
knocks). Hella, open the door! I want to change my clothes. There are callers.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why, never mind, you are
all right!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (turns away, resigned to his
fate). It wouldn't do any good anyhow. Hella does not hear me. Go ahead then!
Bring them right along. [<span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> opens the door at
the right and goes out. Conversation outside becomes audible.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (also comes over to the right,
seems to be in great agitation, controls himself nervously, steps upon the
threshold at the right and addresses those about to enter). <i>This way, if you
please.</i> (He steps aside for <span class="sc">Antoinette</span> and <span class="sc">
Laskowski</span>, and makes a short bow). We are very glad to see you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (seizes both of his hands and
shakes them a number of times). Glad to see you, old chap! Think of seeing you
again. (He and
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> have taken off their wraps outside. He wears
a black morning coat and black gloves.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (reserved). Unfortunately on a sad
occasion!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (in a black gown, simple but
elegant). Be assured of our heartfelt sympathy, doctor! (She extends the tips of
her fingers to him.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (somewhat formally). Thank you
very much, madam! (His eyes are fastened upon her.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (is the last to enter. She
closes the door behind her). Will you not be seated? Antonie, please take the
sofa!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes indeed, madam, please! Or
would you prefer to sit at the fire? You have been riding.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Thank you! I am quite warm.
I'll sit down here. (She sits down on the sofa and lets her eyes roam about.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Think of my wife sitting at
the fire! It would have to come to a pretty pass! One who knocks about in the
open all day long, like her! (He sits down on the chair to the left of the
sofa.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (under a spell). Do you do that,
madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Just as it comes! A little
horseback, skating ... Whatever winter pastimes there may be!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (who is still standing at his
chair). And in summer?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Oh, in summer something else
is doing again! Then there is rowing, fishing and swimming to beat the band!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Fortunately we have the
lake right near our place.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has been speaking privately to <span class="sc">
Aunt Clara</span>). Very well, Auntie, bring us that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Don't go to any trouble,
Miss Clara. We can't stay long.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (winks). Well, well, we'll
remain a bit longer. I'll still have to go to the inn to take a look at that
gelding.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (beckons to his aunt). So bring it
along!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Very well, boysie, I'm
going. (Goes off at the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (sits down in the chair opposite
the sofa and becomes absent-minded again). So you have a lake? Where is it?
Surely not at Klonowken?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. If we only did have that at
Klonowken! We have nothing at all there.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (joining in with laughter).
Heaven knows! The fox and the wolf do the social stunt there!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. The lake is at Rukkoschin.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (informing him). That is the
estate that my dearie brought to me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (abruptly). Yes, yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (laughing). That's a
different layout from the sandy blowouts of Klonowken! Prime soil! And a forest,
I tell you, cousin! Over two thousand acres! One trunk as fine as another! Each
one fit for a ship's mast! If I ever have them cut down! That will put grease
into the pan! Yes, yes, Rukkoschin is a catch that's worth while. We did a good
job of that, didn't we, dearie? (He laughs at <span class="sc">Antoinette</span>
slyly.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I suppose, dear Laskowski, that
no one has ever doubted your slyness.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (strikes his shoulder). Do
you see, Doc, now you say so yourself, and at school you gave me the laugh. That
fool Laskowski, so you thought, he'll never get beyond pounding sand in a
rat-hole. Have I come up a bit in your eyes? How's that, old boy? Shake hands.
Pretty damned long since we have met! (He extends his hand to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>, who does not seem to notice it.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (who has been biting her
lips and looking into space during the words of her husband, suddenly
interrupts). We received the announcement this morning, Mr. Warkentin. We thank
you very much.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (reserved). It was no more than
our duty, madam.</p>
<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Yes, we were very glad, my
wife and I ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (quickly). Not to be
forgotten!...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. You hit the nail on the
head, that's what you did, dearie!
<i>You</i> go on and talk. A fellow like myself isn't so handy with his tongue!
But he feels it just the same!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (grimly). Rather sudden, was it
not, madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. The best thing that one can
wish for!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Do you think so? I don't know.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Of course. Heart failure's
the thing to have!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. It grieved me very much.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, madam.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. You see, he was my
guardian.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I know it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Of course we had not seen
each other for some time ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Goodness, dearie, that's the
way it goes sometimes! This fellow's busy and then that fellow's busy ... It's
not like in the city. But everybody knows how you feel about it, just the same.
And then if you do meet in the city, or at the stockyards, or somewhere else,
the jollification is twice as big. Just lately I met your father in just that
way. It's not been four weeks. Met him at the station just as I was going to
town. And the old gent crossed my path and acted as if he didn't see me. It was
right at the ticket window. Of course, I called him! Good morning, major, says
I! Howdy? Chipper, and up and coming as ever? Oh, says he, not particularly!
Those very words! I can still see him as he stood there!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (incredulously). Why you
didn't tell me a thing about that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Guess I forgot to. Who'd
think it would be the last time. When I heard that he was dead, day before
yesterday, it came to me again. Then we rode in the same compartment and he kept
telling me a lot about you, Doc.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, (sarcastically). Really?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. He was pretty much bothered,
what would become of the place, when he'd be dead and gone ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You don't say!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. On my honor, Doc.! Expect me
to fib to you. Of course I talked him out of it, and told him not to bother
about it. First of all that it wasn't up to him yet, and if it was, <i>I</i> was
still in the ring.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Very kind of you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. With all my heart! You and
me, Doc., h'm? We understand each other! We'll come to terms all right. Old
chap! Old crony! How tickled I am to see you right here before me again! How
often I have said if Paul was only here now. Didn't I, dearie!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (gesture of impatience).
Yes, yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Well, what have you been
doing all this time, Doc.?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. All kinds of things.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Regular old Socrates. It
makes a fellow's wheels buzz to think of what he's got in his head all the time!
Do you remember, old chap, how you used to help me out when we were juniors?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Sophomores, dear Laskowski! You
failed to make junior standing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (strikes his fist on the
table, in great glee). Damn it all! Did you remember that? I see, old chap, that
a fellow has to be on his guard with you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with a determined look). If you
think ...</p>

<p class="center"><a name="pix_160" href="#pixRef_160"><img src="images/pg160.png" alt="Mother_Earth"></a></p>
<p class="center">MOTHER EARTH</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. These fellows from Berlin.
They are up to snuff! That's the place! If they ever come out into the country,
look out, boys. They'll not leave a shirt on your back! Guess you made a good
deal of spondulics in Berlin, didn't you, Doc.? (He goes through with the
gesture of counting money.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (cutting). Why?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Goodness, a fellow will ask
about that. You don't need it, of course. Ellernhof is worth sixty, seventy
thousand dollars any day, and a fellow can live off of that. If you can only
find a buyer ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I haven't the least desire, dear
Laskowski.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. It's a hard thing too,
now-a-days. Buyers are scarce and times are hard for the farmer.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> comes from the right,
carrying a tray with a bottle of wine and glasses.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. You have gone to all this
trouble, after all, Miss Clara.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Not at all worth
mentioning! (Sets the things on the table.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (examines the wine-bottle).
Why, what have you brought here, Miss?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You drink port, don't you, madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (affectionately). If you
don't care for it, dearie, I drink for you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. You <i>may</i> pour me one
glass. (She holds out her glass, which <span class="sc">Paul</span> fills.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> You're sure it won't hurt
you, dearie?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Why should it? I drink on
other occasions.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Because you are always
getting a headache.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (looks at him). I?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Now don't get mad right off!
Can't a fellow crack a joke? Don't you see that it's a joke? Drink ahead,
dearie! I'm drinking too. And then I must be going too.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (who has filled all the glasses).
Must you; where?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (raises his glass and empties
it). Of a forenoon, there's nothing up to a glass of port.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why don't you drink, Aunt Clara!
(He also drinks.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Oh, I don't care much for
wine, my boy, as you may remember. (She sips a little.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (to <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>). Well, did you like it, dearie?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. May I give you some more, madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. No, thank you. It would go
to my head.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (pushes his glass over). I'll
take another glass. Then I must be going. (Looks at his watch.) It's a quarter
of eleven.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (fills it). What else have you in
mind?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Well, since it just fits in,
we being here today, I just want to go over to the inn. They've advertised a
gelding there. Take a look at him. If he can be had cheap ... Haven't put one
over on anybody for some time! (He laughs, empties the glass and holds it up
before him.) Your old gent did invest in a cellar! There ain't a thing, Doc.,
that I envy you as much as that cellar! (He gets up.)</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I shall wait till you return. Come back
soon!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. On the spot, dearie. I'll
only take a vertical whisky over at the inn! Good-by, dearie! Good-by, Doc.! (He
goes out at the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (has also risen, with a sly
look). Mercy, my dinner! You can't depend upon these girls! First thing, it'll
be burned. (She hastens out at the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Did you not bring Mrs.
Warkentin with you, Doctor?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (nervously). Yes, Auntie, please
tell Lene to go around and tell my wife we have callers. This door is locked.
She cannot get through here. (He has risen and walked over to the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (going out). Very well,
Paul, I shall see to it.</p>
<p class="hang2">[Goes off. Pause. <span class="sc">Paul</span> stands at the
fireplace and stares into the fire. <span class="sc">Antoinette</span> has
leaned back on the sofa and is gazing into space.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with an effort). You are not
cold, are you, madam? Or I will put on some more wood.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (without stirring). Not on
my account! I am accustomed to the cold.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (forced). Strange! As <i>hardened</i>
as all that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Completely!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, (takes a step toward her).
Antoinette ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>  (motionless). Doctor?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, (painfully). Once my name was
Paul. Don't you remember?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I have forgotten it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (controls himself). Well then,
madam, may I speak to you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Will you not call your
wife?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. May I not speak to you?</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I don't know what you could have to say.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Something that concerns only you
and me and not another soul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (gets up). I do not <i>care</i>
to hear it. (Takes a few steps into the hall.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (seizes her hand). Antoinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (frees herself). Don't!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Then why have you come?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Don't, I tell you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Then why have you come, I ask of
you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (stands with her back to
him, blurts out). They fairly dragged me here!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. So you did not come of your own
accord?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. No!... I should never have
come!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Antoinette ... Is that the truth?</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> presses her hand to her
face and is silent.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with bowed head). Then to be sure
...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Why in the world doesn't
your wife come in? (She walks toward the window.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Very well! Let her come! (He
bites his lips and turns away.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (appears in the door at the left).
Mr. Warkentin ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (startled). What is it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Mrs. Warkentin says that she has
no time now, she'll come directly.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Very well!... You may go!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Thank you, Mr. Warkentin! (She
casts a glance at the two and goes out. Short pause.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with grim humor). As you see, it
is not to be, madam!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (stands at the window with
her back toward the hall). It would seem so. (Presses her face against the
panes.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (walks to and fro, then approaches
her). I have had to endure much, Antoinette, very much!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (suppressed). Possibly I
have too.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why, Antoinette, you are weeping?
(He stands behind her and tries to look into her face.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (wards him off). I? Not at
all!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (heavily). You are weeping,
Antoinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (sinks down). I can't help
it. (She surrenders to her pain, but quietly and softly, making her appear all
the more touching.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (kindly). Come, madam! Let me
conduct you to the sofa. (About to take her arm.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (refusing). I can go alone.
Why do you concern yourself about me at all?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Antoinette! Don't be stubborn at
this moment! Our time is short. Who knows whether we shall ever speak to each
other again as we now do. (He leads her forward a short distance.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. All the better!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Our time is awfully short. <i>I
cannot</i> let you go away so! We must make use of the moment! (Bitterly.) The
moment that will possibly never return. (He has slowly led her to the front of
the stage.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (frees herself violently).
Do permit me to go by myself! I do not need you! I need no one!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (bitterly). Very well! I shall not
molest you! As you please!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (sits down in the chair at
the left of the sofa, seems composed again). You see I am quite calm. It was
only a temporary indisposition.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (coaxing). May I sit down near
you, Antoinette?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. What have you to say to me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, (sits down in the chair before
her, looks at her squarely, then, after a moment of devoted contemplation). I am
forced to look at you, Antoinette! Pardon me! I am forced to look at you again
and again!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Do save up these
compliments for your wife, doctor!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with growing excitement). No
compliments, Antoinette! The moment is too precious!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Then why don't you spare
yourself the trouble?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Didn't you feel it, the very
moment you came in, Antoinette; I could not keep away from you.</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Quite flattering!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Antoinette! Now you must listen
to me to the very end.</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Goodness! What do you expect of me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Or you should not have come!</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Why in the world <i>did</i> I do it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (fervently, but in an undertone).
Antoinette! You are so wonderful! More wonderful than I have ever seen you
before!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (sarcastically). Oh, indeed
...! Possibly you are even sorry.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (straightens up, harshly). For
shame, madam. Such expressions are not suited to you! Leave them to others!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (passionately). Your own
fault! You have brought mo to this!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (painfully). You have become
unfeeling, Antoinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I am simply no longer that
stupid little creature that you can wind around your finger as once upon a time.
Do you still remember that Christmas Eve, Doctor Warkentin?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I remember it all, Antoinette.
Why on that evening my life was decided.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. So was mine. In this very
hall. I sat at this very place and you before me as now. There is such a thing
as providence. I have always believed in that! But now I see it with my own
eyes. God in heaven will not be mocked! On my knees I have prayed to him ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (frightened). Antoinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (furiously). On my knees I
prayed for him to punish you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Toinette, you are mad! What awful
injury did I inflict upon you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (Scornfully). You upon me?
Oh, none at all! Did you know about me at all? You scorned me! What, that stupid
little thing wants me, the great man! Who am I and what is she! Off with her.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Toinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (filled with hatred). Yes,
off with her. And I did throw myself away! I knew all the time it would spell
misfortune for me if I married this ... this man.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (starts up). Is that the way
matters stand?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Yes, indeed, that's the way
they stand. I don't think of making a secret of it. The whole world knows it. It
is shouted from the house-tops!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (clenches his fists). The dog!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. It's easy for you to use
strong terms now. You hounded me into it! I owe it all to you. But one
consolation has remained for me. I have become unhappy. But so are you! And that
is why I have come.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (straightens up). What does this
mean, Antoinette?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Heavens! Simple enough! You
do take an interest in the woman that has been preferred to you. You would like
to make the acquaintance of such a marvel.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (offended). You are malicious,
madam!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Not at all. I only wanted
to see, with my own eyes, how happy you are. But I am quite sufficiently
informed. One only needs to take a look at you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (painfully). Are you satisfied
now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (from the bottom of her
heart). Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Are you compelled to detest me?</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Do you expect me to thank you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (fervently). Does it really make
you happy to talk to me in this manner, Antoinette?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Happy or not, what I have
vowed before the altar, I shall not fail to keep.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (earnestly and sadly). I am the
last person to hinder you, Toinette! But I surely may look at you? Will you
forbid that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (struggling with herself).
Don't talk to me in this manner!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (excited). Just look into your
face, Antoinette, the few moments that remain! Stamp upon my mind how much I
have lost! Look into your eyes, just once more! Into your wonderful eyes!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (jumps up). Don't talk to me
in this manner, I say. I haven't deserved it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has also risen, seizes her hand).
Antoinette, I have found none of the things that I was seeking. I have been
miserably deceived! Are you satisfied now?</p>

<p class="hang1">      [<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> sinks back into her
chair, begins to sob spasmodically.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (wildly). Why aren't you glad? (He
strides through the hall.)</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> chokes down her sobs.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (comes back again, bows down to
her). Weep, Antoinette! Weep! I wish I could. (He softly presses a kiss upon her
hair). [Silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (jumps up). I must go! Where
is my husband? I must have fresh air! My head! (She looks crazed.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (takes her arm). Yes, fresh air,
Toinette, there we shall feel less constraint. It is fine outside, the snow is
falling. Everything is white. Everything is old. Just as both of us have become,
Toinette.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (leaning on him). I am so
afraid! So terribly afraid!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (leading her to the door). You
will feel better. Snow is soothing. Come and I will tell you about my life.
Possibly you will forgive me then, Antoinette? (He looks at her imploringly and
extends his hand to her).</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (hesitates a moment, then
opening her eyes widely she lays her hand in his). Possibly!...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (happy). Thank you, Toinette!
Thank you!... And now come.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (on his arm, sadly). Where
shall we go?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. To the park, Toinette, to the
brook, do you remember, to the alders?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (nods). To the alders, I
remember.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Out into the snow, to seek our
childhood.</p>

<h2>ACT III</h2>


<p class="hang1">The same hall as on the preceding days. The two corners in the
foreground, on the right the fireplace with its chairs, on the left the sofa and
other furniture are both separated from the centre and background of the hall by
means of a rectangular arrangement of oleanders in pots, thus affording two
separate cozy corners, between whose high borders of oleander a somewhat narrow
passage leads to the background. A banquet board in the form of a horseshoe, the
sides of which run to the rear and are hidden by the oleanders. The centre,
forming the head of the board, is plainly visible from the passage. It is almost
noon. Dim light, reflected from the snow outside, comes in through the middle
window of the back wall, a view of which is afforded through the opening in the
centre. The snowflakes flutter down drearily as on the previous day. The fire
now and then casts a red light upon the oleanders, which separate the space
surrounding the fireplace from the background. <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>,
in mourning as before, and <span class="sc">Lene</span>, also dressed in black,
are busy at the table, which has been set. They move to and fro arranging
plates, glasses and bottles. After a moment.</p>
<br>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (comes forward in the
direction of the passage, inspects the whole arrangement and speaks to <span class="sc">
Lene</span> who is occupied in the background, where she cannot be seen). Are
all of the knives and forks properly arranged back there?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (not visible). Everything's in
order, Miss Clara.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why, then we are through.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. They can come right along now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I can't help but think that
it's time for the bell. (The old clock in the corridor outside begins to
strike.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (has come forward). It's striking
twelve.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. You're certain, are you,
that the roast is being basted properly?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Oh, Lizzie's looking after
things.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. The sermon seems to be
pretty long.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Oh, he can never find his finish.
Miss Clara.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Let him talk, for all I
care! Only I might have put off the dinner.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (listens). Now the bell is
ringing. (Distant, indistinct tones of a church bell are heard.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (also listens). Yes, they
are ringing. Then it is over. (She folds her hands as if in prayer.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (timidly). Now the coffin's in the
ground, ain't it, Miss Clara?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (murmurs). God grant him
eternal peace!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (also with hands folded). Amen!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (continues murmuring). And
light everlasting shine for him!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (as before). Amen!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (partly to herself). I <i>
should</i> have been glad to pay him the last honor, but it <i>was</i>
impossible. What would have become of the roast? We shall see each other in the
next world anyhow. It will not be
<i>very</i> long!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (comforting her). Oh, Miss Clara.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (seizes her arm). Don't
stand there! Do your work! They will surely be here directly, (Counts the
places.) Six ... eight ... twelve ... sixteen ... eighteen ... twenty ...
twenty-two ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. That's the number. There are
eight sleighs.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Go and open the door of the
green room!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (goes off to the left). What <i>
will</i> Mrs. Warkentin say to that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. <i>I</i> will attend to
that. It can't be helped today. We shall have to use the rooms for our coffee
later.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (returns). She'll make a nice
fuss!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Off with you now. They are
coming. Take the ladies and gentlemen into the front rooms until we have the
dinner on the table. Then you can go and call them.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Very well, Miss Clara. (Quickly
off to the right.)</p>
<p class="hang2">[Short pause, during which <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>
stands listening. Then
        <span class="sc">Hella</span> enters from the right, dressed in black.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with a quick glance to the left,
then to <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> who has retreated to the background).
What is the matter with my room? Why are the doors open?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. The guests certainly must
have some place where they can relax a bit, later on.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (nonplussed). In my rooms?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. They surely can't sit
around in this one place the whole afternoon. They must take their coffee <i>
some</i>where.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (from the left). Why I <i>do</i>
say ...! Really! All of my books are gone!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (indifferently). I put
things to rights a bit, madam. Why I
<i>couldn't</i> leave them as they were. I took the books upstairs.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Upstairs! Very well, then that's
where <i>I</i> will go. (Starts out toward the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (enters and runs into <span class="sc">
Hella</span>). Where are you going?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I am going upstairs.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. <i>Where</i> are you going!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Upstairs. I <i>can't</i> find a
nook down <i>here</i> today where I might rest.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. So you really refuse to dine with
us?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (places her hand on his arm).
Spare me the agony, Paul! You know I can't endure so many strangers. It will
give me a headache.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Stay a short time at least! Show
that much consideration!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (retreats a step). Consideration
... No one shows <i>me</i> any consideration!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (pacing up and down). Nice mess,
when not even the nearest relatives ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Why, you are to be present.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. But you must be present! I desire
it, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. And what if I simply <i>cannot</i>?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (plants himself before her). Why
not?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Because I cannot. Because I hate
these feeds!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (more calmly). That is correct. So
do I! But what can we do about it? It <i>is</i> the custom.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Custom, Paul, custom!... Have we
founded our life upon old customs?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (embittered). If we only had!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (looks at him sharply). Do you
think so?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, possibly we should have
fared better.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (very emphatically). And then, my
dear, I will tell you one thing more. You are compelling me to do so.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And that is?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I don't care to lie.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I don't care to feign, to these
people, feelings that are entirely absent. That is why I am going upstairs.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (very calmly). Does that refer to
... the dead?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, it does! I did not know <i>
him</i> and he did not know <i>me</i>! Did not care to know me. What obligations
remain for me? None at all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Are you serious?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (bolt upright). In all
seriousness. Now it is out.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (quite calm). Very well, then go!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I'll see you later. (She goes
toward the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (struggles for composure, then
suddenly). Hella! For <i>my</i> sake ... Do <i>not</i> go. Stay here!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (turns to him). No, Paul, one
should not force himself to do such things. Put the responsibility upon your
father! I am not to blame. I am only acting as I must. You would do the same.
[Off at the right.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (beside himself). It's well that
you are reminding me of that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (approaches). Shall I remove
your wife's plate?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, take the plate away.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Have you seen the
Laskowskis?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, at the cemetery, Auntie. I
shall go now and call the guests. (Goes off.)</p>

<p class="hang1">      [<span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> walks toward the
right, shaking her head, then pulls the bell.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (comes in from the right, behind
the scene). What is it. Miss Clara?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Have the soup brought in!
It will take me some time to fill all of the plates, anyhow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Very well!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Now where are you to serve?
And where is the coachman to serve? You haven't forgotten?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. I am to serve on the right and
the coachman on the left. Is that right?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Yes, you may go! And don't
forget, all serving is to be done by way of the green room! Be sure not to come
in from this side! [<span class="sc">Lene</span> goes off.]</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> retires to the background,
where she is occupied for some time, without being very much in evidence. The
door at the right is opened.]</p>

ladies and gentlemen! In this way! (<span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>, <span class="sc">

side). I don't know, but that cemetery put a stitch into my side.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. Yes, that was a nasty, cold
snow. If we only get something to eat soon!... So we can warm up!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Ought to be a bit
careful of yourself at your age, Mr. Raabe!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe</span>. Why, how old <i>am</i> I?
Seventy!</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Not worth mentioning, eh? Prime of
life!... How old
<i>was</i> Warkentin?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. Why we just heard about that
in the sermon, sixty-two!</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Not very old!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe</span>. Yes, that's the way they go ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. To the grand army, eh Raabe,
old boy? Who knows when we will get our orders.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe</span>. It will be our turn next.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Don't say that! It is
not a matter of age! Look at Warkentin, did he give evidence of his end?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. The affair with his son put
him over, or he would be here today.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span> (looks around). Why,
where is the young man?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. Pretty nice fellow in other
respects!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. He will have a deuce of
a time if he intends to farm here. You can't pick that up helter skelter. Has
any one heard? Does he intend to take it on? Or is he going to sell?</p>
<p class="hang2">[He turns toward the rear. Meanwhile <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>, <span class="sc">Paul</span>, AND
        <span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> have entered from the right and have
joined a group of guests in the background.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe</span>. In the old days the son always
followed in the footsteps of his father. The son of a land-owner became a
land-owner. That's all out of style now. Everybody goes to school.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. Well, your son is doing that
very thing, Raabe.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe, Jr</span>. (has come forward). Good
morning, Mr. Schnaase!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. Good morning, brother
student!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe, Jr</span>. Well, pa?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe</span>. Well, my son?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. Keeping right after
beerology, young man?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe, Jr</span>. Purty well, thanks! A fellow
guzzles his way through.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. How many semesters does this
make, Mr. Raabe?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe, Jr</span>. Mebbie you'd better not ask
about that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe</span>. How many semesters? Twelve!
Isn't that it, my son?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe, Jr</span>. Astoundingly correct!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. Then I suppose you'll tackle
the examinations one of these days, Mr. Raabe?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe, Jr</span>. There's plenty of time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe</span>. Just let him study his fill! I'm
not at all in favor of too much hurry! He'll get office and emoluments soon
enough.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. I know one thing, <i>my</i>
boy will not get into a gymnasium! The agricultural school for him, till he can
qualify for the one year's service and off with him. No big notions for him!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe</span> (holds his side). Outch, there's
my stitch again!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe, Jr</span>. Take a whisky, pa! Shall I
get us a couple?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe</span>. A few fingers might not do any
harm.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schnaase</span>. <i>Have</i> the girl before
you kiss her, according to Lehmann.[A]</p>

<p class="hang2">[Footnote A: Nickname of Emperor William I, who according to

the arrangements). That is not exactly extraordinary.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. Oh, I don't know,
Elizabeth, I find it quite pretty.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. And the wife does
not seem to be much in evidence.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. Yes, she seems a bit
high toned.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. <i>Quite a bit.</i>
I wonder what kind of notions <i>she</i>
has about the society that she has encountered here!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. Do you think they will
stay here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. Such creatures blow
in from Berlin, puff up like a turkey gobbler. I'd hate to know about her past!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. Mrs. Laskowski looks
pretty interesting today.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. Do you think so?
Well, perhaps she has her reasons.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. You don't say! Do tell.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. Don't you know
about it at all?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. Why no, what? I don't
get out very much, you know.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. It was before your
day. You were not here then. I have a dim recollection, when I was quite a young
girl.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span> (all ear, seizes her
arm). Is it possible? What was it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span> (subdued). She had
an affair with him ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. With whom, pray tell?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. The <i>man</i> with
whom she is standing there.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. Why that is young Mr.
Warkentin.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. Pst. They are
coming. (Quite subdued.) Later she married her husband out of spite, because she
did not get him!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span> (squints curiously at <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>). To think that she would still talk to him!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. Heavens, what does
she care! (To <span class="sc">Dr. Bodenstein</span>, who is quietly conversing
with <span class="sc">Mertens</span> at the fireplace.) Doctor, just a word!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dr. Bodenstein</span>. At your service, madam!
(He straightens up promptly and hastens to her.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. I only wanted to
ask about a trifling matter, Doctor.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dr. Bodenstein</span>. I shall be <i>delighted</i>,
madam.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. But no one must
hear us. (Both disappear to the rear.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span> (has also stepped out from the
recess of the fireplace, to
<span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>). If you are willing to put up with me for
the present, madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. Oh, thank you very much!
But I might ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. Please, please, madam! May I
offer you my arm? (He takes her arm.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Josupeit</span> (has rushed up to the two from
the background). Too late! Just my luck! <i>I</i> was about to report!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. You will have to get up a bit
earlier the next time, my dear fellow; <i>I</i> shall take you to the table,
madam.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Josupeit</span> (from the other side). Take me
to the table dear, good madam! I'll tell you something quite interesting too.</p>

<span class="sc">Josupeit</span> (is silent for a moment, then continues).
Another man of honor gone. (<span class="sc">Paul</span> nods silently. <span class="sc">
Josupeit</span> again after a brief silence.) Terribly sudden!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (nods again and says). But I must
not detain you, Mr. Josupeit!</p>

the way of it! Just back from the cemetery. One buried forever, and the next
moment all of their thoughts somewhere else. Joyous and of good cheer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (stares into the fire,
bitterly). Yes, that's the way of it!</p>

are dead. We shall have the same fate some day, madam.</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Of course we shall. It is immaterial to me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looks at her). Really?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. It does not matter to me,
whether it comes today or tomorrow. Sometime I shall have to go! So the quicker
the better. It is all over with me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Antoinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. You may believe me, I am
quite serious!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (completely absorbed, as he looks
at her). How calmly you say that! In the very bloom of life! I cannot think of
you thus.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. How?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Cold and dead.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. But I can. Very well
indeed. I am so now!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That isn't true, Antoinette. Your
eyes tell a different story!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (shrugging her shoulders).
Never mind my eyes!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. But I can't help it. I must look
into them! I feel as if I must find something there.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (turning away). Don't go to
any trouble!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Indeed, indeed, Antoinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. What in the world could you
find?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. ... Possibly my lost life?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (excited). Why do you speak
so to me, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Do I hear it from your lips,
Paul, Paul, as of old?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (frightened). Paul! Paul!
Desist!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. It has been a long time since I
have heard that sound!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Desist, at least for today,
I beg of you! It seems like a sin to me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why like a sin?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. You were just remarking
about the rest, and now you are doing the same thing, forgetting the dead.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I&#8212;forget him? I am thinking of
him incessantly! And of his last words, before we parted forever! Do you know
what they were, Toinette?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (subdued). Tell me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. &quot;Go! Some day you will be sorry!&quot;
... Possibly he was right, the dear old man! Today it kept resounding from his
open grave, as the clods and lumps of snow rumbled down on his coffin. &quot;Are you
sorry now? Are you sorry now?&quot; ... I have tried to get rid of it, but it refuses
to go. It keeps pursuing me and cries into my ears!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (has approached the two).
Well, dearie, how are you? What are you doing?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (turns around, as if
recoiling from something poisonous). Oh, it's you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Who would it be? Ain't it up
to me to look after my dearie now and then. Shan't we eat? They are all sitting
down.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has become composed). Your
husband is quite right, madam. We are the last. Unfortunately Mrs. Warkentin is
not very well. May I request you to play the part of the hostess a bit?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (distressed). If it must be,
Doctor ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looks at her). Yes, there is no
help for it, madam. (Escorts her through the passage to the table.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (following them). And I, old
boy. Where am I to go?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (grimly). Wherever you please! The
world is wide and there is room for all. (He leads Antoinette around the table
to her place.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. I guess the shortest way is
the best! I'm going to sit right here. (He sits down beside <span class="sc">
Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>, all the rest have also gradually taken their places.
The order at the visible central portion of the table is as follows, from left
to right: Outside, <span class="sc">Kunze</span>,
<span class="sc">Laskowski</span>, <span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>, <span class="sc">
Director Mertens</span>, <span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>; opposite these
inside, <span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span>, <span class="sc">Paul</span>, <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>, <span class="sc">Mr. von Tiedemann</span>, <span class="sc">
Dr. Bodenstein</span>. During the whole of the following scene they are eating
and drinking. <span class="sc">Lene</span> and <span class="sc">Fritz</span>, in
livery, move to and fro, serving. <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> comes in
and goes out as the occasion demands. She has her seat with those who are hidden
and whose voices are only heard at times. At first the conversation remains
subdued.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Kunze</span> (rises). Ladies and gentlemen!
Before sitting down at the board, to regale ourselves with food and drink, does
it not involve upon us to devote a few words to the memory of the beloved
deceased, whose mortal remains we have today conducted to the last resting
place. And how can we do that more fittingly, ladies and gentlemen, than by
recalling the words recorded in holy writ. Ladies and gentlemen, what are the
words of the psalmist? The days of our years are three-score years and ten; and
if, by reason of strength, they be four-score years, yet is their strength labor
and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we fly away! Ladies and gentlemen! He who
no longer dwells in our midst in the body, but whose spirit is looking down upon
all of us, the beloved deceased, may he rest in peace.</p>
<p class="right">[Silence. Short pause as they continue to eat.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (the first to finish his
soup, leans back). A soup like that does warm a fellow up.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Especially when you have
been out in your sleigh for nearly two hours.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. And then a full hour at the
cemetery on top of it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span> (quickly). But the
sermon was really touching. From the very heart. Any one who had known the dead
man ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Not a soul kept from crying!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Yes, remarkably
beautiful!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. A fellow forgot all about
being hungry.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span> (leans over to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>). Are they talking about the sermon?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (aloud). Yes, Mrs. Borowski.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span>. I didn't understand very
much.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (courteously). At your age, Mrs.
Borowski!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span> (in an undertone to <span class="sc">
Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>). Who is she?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. It's the widow of
the former teacher at the estate here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. She seems to hail from the
days of the French occupation!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. <i>Does</i> she? She has
at least eighty years on her back.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. But is well preserved.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span> (to <span class="sc">Paul</span>).
I say, Mr. Warkentin, I knew your father when he was no bigger than ... (Holding
her hand not far from the ground.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (subdued). Fifty years ago?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span>. Oh, it's longer than
that. Almost sixty. I saw them all grow up. Now I'm almost the only one left
from those times.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (leans over toward her with
his glass). Well, here's to you Auntie!... You don't drink very much any more I
suppose? (He drinks.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span>. Oh, indeed! I am still
able to take a glass.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Come, Mrs. Borowski, let me help
you. (He fills her glass.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span>. When I was young I never
caught sight of wine. Now that I'm old I have more than I can drink.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Drink ahead, Auntie! Drink
ahead! Wine makes you young!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span>. You know, your good wife
is always sending me some.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (nonplussed). I do say,
dearie, why, I don't know a thing about that.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> silently shrugs her
shoulders and casts a quick glance at him.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (friendly again). Makes no
difference, dearie, no difference at all! Just send ahead! We do have a lot of
it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. There is surely enough for
us to spare a little for an old lady.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Sure, dearie!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span> (leans over to <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>). Do you remember, pet, how you used to come and call with
your parents, now dead and gone? A little bit of a thing you were, Paul would
lift you on the horse and you didn't cry at all, you sat there just like a
grown-up ... I remember it very well.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I don't. Such things <i>are</i>
forgotten.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looks at her). Have you really
forgotten that, madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Heavens, I haven't thought
of it again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span>. Just wait and see, pet,
when you are old you will think of it again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Not all people grow to be
as old as you, dear Mrs. Borowski.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (has partaken freely of the
wine). Dearie, you'll grow as old as the hills! I can prophesy that much.
Haven't you the finest kind of a time!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I?... Of course!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (garrulously). What do you
lack!... Nuthin'!... Children's what you lack!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (looks at him sharply).
Never mind, please!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (abashed). Well, well, don't
put on so, dearie!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span> (to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>). Have you any children, Doctor?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. No, I'm sorry to say, madam.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mr. von Tiedemann</span> (to his wife). We're
better off in that respect, Bess, aren't we? Three lusty bairns!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. And <i>we</i>, with our
five!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (touched). Do you see,
dearie! What am I always tellin' you! An agriculturalist without children ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Kunze</span>. Abraham scored one hundred when
the Lord bestowed his son Isaac upon him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. But a fellow like me can't
wait that long&#8212;stuff and nonsense. What if I die and ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You will take care not to do
that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Don't say that, brother! I'm
going to die young! I'm sure of it. An old woman once told my fortune, and she
said I wouldn't see more than fifty. But, do you know what, dearie?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span> (to <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>). I suppose you frequently came to Ellernhof in the old days,
Madam von Laskowski?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Why, the departed was my
guardian, you know, Mrs. Von Tiedemann.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. Oh yes. I had
forgotten that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Do you ride horseback as
much as ever, madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Now and then, for pastime!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Now don't you say a word,
dearie! Why, you're pasted on a horse all day long, and then from horseback
right into the cold, cold water. Did anybody ever hear the like of it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (to <span class="sc">Antoinette</span>).
Yesterday I had a horseback ride again too, madam. Have I told you about it? The
first time in years. And, what is more, I got quite near your place. I was even
able to see the houses of Klonowken.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Did you ride through the
forest?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Of course, through the pine
forest of Klonowken, yesterday morning. Right through the snow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Why, I was out at the same
time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looks at her). You were, madam?
Too bad! Why did we not chance to meet?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I suppose it was not
ordained so.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (after drinking again). I
say, dearie, one of these days when I die, do you know what I'll do?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. If one of us dies, I'll go to
Karlsbad, eh, Laskowski?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Listen, dearie! You'll
inherit all I have an' marry another fellow!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (sternly). Control yourself a bit,
Laskowski.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (undaunted). Ain't that true,
dearie? Tell me that you'll come to my grave! Promise me that much, dearie! Then
I'll die easy. You'll come along and sit down and cry a few tearies on my grave.
(He chokes down his tears and drinks again.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span> (has also been drinking
freely). Well, here's to our friend, departed in his prime. (He raises his glass
to <span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span> (disapprovingly).
Why, Fritz!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span> (collecting himself).
H'm! Well ... Didn't think of
<i>that</i>. One forgets. Pardon me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Will you not help
yourselves, ladies and gentlemen? (To
<span class="sc">Lene</span>, who is just passing with dishes in her hands.)
Serve around once more!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span> (helps himself). My
favorite dish, veal-roast!... (To
<span class="sc">Bodenstein</span>. ) What do you say, Doctor, you are so quiet?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dr. Bodenstein</span>. Do whatever you do,
with a will! I am now devoting myself to culinary delights!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. I regard this sauce a
phenomenal achievement.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. There are tomatoes in
it, I think.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. I must ask for the recipe.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe, Junior's</span>(voice in the
background). Here's to you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Voices</span> (in confusion, in the
background). Here's to you! Your health!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (gets up, raises his glass
toward the background). Here's to everybody!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Voices</span> (from behind). Here's to you,
Laskowski!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schrock's</span> (voice). Here's to you, old
rough-neck!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Don't drink so much, Laskowski! (<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>
bites her lips and looks away.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (whispering). Let me drink,
brother! Drink and forget your pain, says Schiller. Ain't that it, old chap,
ain't it, now? You're a kind of a poet yourself, ain't you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span> (in an undertone, to <span class="sc">
Mertens</span>). He's tanking up again!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (to <span class="sc">Paul</span>,
through her teeth). Awful!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (in an undertone). Oh, don't mind
him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Let me drink, old fellow.
I'm not going to live long anyhow. It's on my chest ... Do you hear it rattle,
old boy? Listen! Just listen! Listen to <i>me</i>, not to my dearie. When we're
dead, we're out of it! We'll not get another drop! An' then we'll sleep till
judgment day in the pitch-dark grave. Then you'll be rid of me, dearie!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (gets up). Excuse me,
Doctor!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (also jumps up). Are you ill,
madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span> (moves aside). Now
it is getting a bit uncanny.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span> (her hand at her ear).
Are they talking about the judgment day?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Kunze</span> (who eats away lustily, partly to
himself). On the judgment day when the Lord will return to judge the quick and
the dead.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (to <span class="sc">Antoinette</span>,
who partly leans upon him). How are you, Antoinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (has become composed again).
I am all right again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Schnaase</span>. Would you like a glass
of water?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span>. Yes, water!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. No, thank you! This awful
heat!... Don't let me disturb you.</p>
<p class="hang2">[The conversation which had become very loud is carried on in a
more subdued manner. All are whispering to each other.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, Shall I take you out, madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (with a supreme effort). No,
thank you, I shall remain! (Sits down again.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (with a stupid stare). Just
stay here, dearie! Just stay here!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Now do be quiet, Laskowski. (Also
sits down again.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> Ain't I quiet, brother?
Quiet!... Quiet!... Quiet!... Quiet as the grave! Damn it all. I wonder how your
father feels now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Kunze</span>. We are happy, but he is happier.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (frantically controlling
herself). Help yourselves, ladies and gentlemen! Mr. von Tiedemann, don't be
backward!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. I'm getting my share.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. So am I. I don't let things
affect my appetite.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (singing half audibly).
Jinks, do you have to die, young as you are ... young as ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span> (to <span class="sc">Paul</span>).
Now it has come, just as the departed always wished.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. How so, Mrs. Borowski?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. Borowski</span>. That you would be back,
Paul, and that everything about the estate would go right on as before! If he
could only look down upon that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (nervously). Yes!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span> (leans over to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>). Settled fact is it, Mr. Warkentin? Really going to get into the
harness?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (pricking up his ears). Can't
do it, old chap! Come on!... Can't begin to do it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I do intend to, Mr. von
Tiedemann.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Well, you'd better think
that over! Not every one can match your father as an agriculturalist.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. With a little honest effort ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. If <i>that</i> were all!
To begin with, you can't match your father physically. You have to be accustomed
to such things. In all kinds of weather! And then ... No child's play to farm
now-a-days! Starvation prices for grain! Simply a shame! If that continues I'll
vouch that all this blooming farming will go to the devil within twenty years!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mrs. von Tiedemann</span> (shaking her head).
To think of having you speak that way, Fritz!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Of course, if a fellow
has a few pennies to fall back on, it's not so bad. But how many are there who
have. The rest will go broke!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (hums again). The Count of
Luxemburg has squandered all his cash ... cash ... cash ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span> (eagerly). And who will
have the advantage? The few who have money. They will buy for a song and some
day, when times are better again, they will sell for twice as much. Some day
they are likely to roll in wealth!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (as before). Has squandered
all his cash ... In one old merry night ... ha, ha!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (leans back in her chair).
My husband is no longer conscious of what he is saying!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Me? Not conscious?... Don't
I know. Word for word! Shall I tell you, dearie? What you said and what I said
and what Paul said to you ... Antoinette, how are you?... How are you
Antoinette? (Short laugh.) Well, do I know, dearie? Did I hold on to it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. One must excuse you in your
condition.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Don't worry about <i>him</i>,
madam. He's one of these fellows with a big purse. He may chuckle! I can foresee
that he will buy up the whole county some day!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Just what I'll do. What's
the price of the world! Five bits a fling!... We can still raise that much. The
more foolish the farmer, the bigger his spuds!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. His sugar-beets!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. I say, boys!... Do you know
how many tons of sugar-beets I raised to the acre! Last round?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Now, don't Spread it on!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (jumps up). Fellows! My word
of honor! I'm not lying! Thirty-five tons an acre! Who can match that? Nobody
can! I can! I'm a devil of a fellow, I've always said so, ain't I, dearie? You
know! (He strikes his chest and sits down.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. Thirty-five ton per
acre! Ridiculous!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mertens</span>. I can honestly swear to the
contrary!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. And your dad, I tell you he
was mad! He just couldn't look at me! But I don't bear him any grudge! I'm a man
of honor! Shake hands, old chap! You say so, ain't I a man of honor? Put 'er
there! Man of honor face to face with man of honor. But you must look at me, man
alive! Or I won't believe you! (He extends his hand over to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (negative gesture). Never mind!
Just believe me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (looks at <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>). Dearie, don't make such a face! Eat! Eat!... So you can get
strong, so you can survive your poor Heliodor! (All except <span class="sc">Paul</span>
and <span class="sc">Antoinette</span> laugh.)</p>

You really haven't taken a thing, madam!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I am not hungry. But will
the ladies and gentlemen not take something more? A little more of the dessert,
perhaps.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. No, thanks, madam! I
can't eat another thing! Not if I try! Or I'll burst!</p>

now a little cup of coffee!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">von Tiedemann</span>. And a cock-tail!</p>

Whenever the ladies and gentlemen are so disposed ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (interrupts). If I'de been
your father, old chap, I'd drunk all of my claret before my wind-up! I wouldn't
'a left a drop!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Schrock's</span> (voice). Greedy gut!</p>

<p class="right">[All get up and are about to exchange formalities.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Raabe Junior's</span> (voice in the
background). Here's to you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dr. Bodenstein</span> (knocks on his glass,
with a loud voice). Ladies and gentlemen! Let us dedicate a glass to the memory
of the departed, according to the beautiful tradition of our fathers; that we
must not mourn the dead, that we should envy them! Our slumbering friend lives
on in the memory of those who were near to him! To immortality, in this sense,
all of us may, after all, agree in a manner! (He raises his glass and clinks
with those beside him. All the rest do the same. Silence prevails. Only the
clinking of glasses is heard.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (raising his glass, to <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>). The doctor is right! Let us drink to his memory, madam! May
the earth rest lightly on him! (<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> lowers her
head and stifles her tears.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looking at her fervently). Aren't
yon going to respond?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (musters her strength,
raises her head, and with tears in her eyes clinks glasses with him).</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (drinks). To the memory of my
father.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (nods). Your father!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. To that of our parents, madam! A
silent glass! (He empties his glass.)</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> puts down her glass, after
she has drunk.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (has noticed <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>). Just cry ahead, dearie! Cry your fill! That's the way
they'll drink to your Heliodor some day!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dr. Bodenstein</span>. And so they will drink
to all of us some day!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Kunze</span>. For man's life on earth is like
unto the grass of the field, on which the wind bloweth. It flourisheth for a
season and withereth and no one remembereth it. So also the children of men.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dr. Bodenstein</span>. This goblet to the
departed, one and all! (He drinks again.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. The departed on these walls! I
drink to you! (He raises his glass to the portraits on the walls. All have risen
meanwhile, and broken up into new groups. Confusion of voices in the
background.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (is forced to smile). Even to
damnation, I dare say?</p>

their force for both of us!</p>

now! Not today! Promise me!</p>

come to an end.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. It shall! But let <i>me</i>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>, Yes, the day and the hour,
do you hear?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Antoinette, if you put the matter
in this way ... I cannot refuse, whatever you may ask!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Only one more day! Then I
will write or come and tell you. Will you be ready?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Then I shall be ready for
anything! Then we shall have a reckoning. Then life shall begin all over again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Yes, another life!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (sadly). Even though the sun is
already sinking.... Possibly there is still time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I shall do anything for you
and you will do anything for me.... We agree to that! (They look into each
other's eyes.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (gently). Do you remember,
Toinette, on this very spot ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Ten years ago? I do! I do!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. How strangely all has come about
and how necessary nevertheless! So predestined! So inexorable! Fate! Fate!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (brooding). I hung upon your
lips and you ignored me! I had ceased to exist for you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And so we lost each other.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. But today, today we have
found each other once more, oh lover of my youth!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Late, Toinette, so late!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Heavens, how stupid I was
in those days!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Stupid because you loved me,
Toinette?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. No, because I did not tell
you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And I did not suspect it! Now who
was worse?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Both of us, dear! We were
too young!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And today I am an old man!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. And what of <i>me</i> ...
An old woman!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Beloved!... Young and beautiful
as ever. How young you have remained all of these years!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. For your sake, dear. I knew
that I must remain young till you would return! That is why I insisted upon
riding like a Cossack ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That is why?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. And swimming like a trout
in the stream! And rowing like a sailor!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And all in order to remain young
and beautiful?... You vain, vain creature!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (mysteriously). And in order
to forget, you foolish, foolish fellow!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (to himself, bitterly). In order
to forget!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (taking his head in her
hands). Don't think of it! Don't think of it! Now we have found each other
again. That too is past!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, all is past! I have you and
shall never leave you!... (Looking up at the walls). Yes, look down upon me out
of your frames! Father and mother, envy me! Venerable hall, rarely have you
beheld such happiness!...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Happiness and death in one,
lover!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Possibly they are one and the
same! (The door at the left is opened, both get up.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara's</span> (voice from the left).
Paul, are you here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (turning around very calmly). Is
it you, Hella?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. As you see! (She stands
immediately before them, looks at them with a hostile expression; to <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span>. ) I beg your pardon, madam!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (nods her head). Please!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (coldly). What do you wish?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (looks at him nonplussed, is
silent a moment and then says curtly). Where is Glyszinski? I need him!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (as before). There, if you please.
If you will take the trouble to step into the next room ... (<span class="sc">Laskowski</span>
and <span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>, arm in arm, enter from the left,
followed by the other guests.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (very tipsy, but not
completely robbed of his senses). Brother! Polish brother! Don't leave me in the
lurch ... Help me find my dearie!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (with head erect). Here I
am.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span> (sobered at the sight of
her). Why dearie, where have you been? Have you had a long talk with Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (extends her hand to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>). Good-by, Doctor!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Good-by, madam! We shall see each
other again! (He looks squarely into her eye.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (significantly). We <i>shall</i>
see each other again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Laskowski</span>. Shan't we go, dearie? Why,
it's almost evening.
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Yes, almost evening. I am ready. (She walks
over to the right calmly and goes out. The guests prepare to go.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (has been standing silently
witnessing the scene, and now approaches <span class="sc">Paul</span>). What
does this mean, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (about to go, frigidly). A woman
whom I knew in the old days!... Good-by. (He leaves her and goes out at the
right with the guests.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (partly to herself, partly
calling after him). Paul! What <i>does</i>
this mean?... Paul!</p>

<h2>ACT IV</h2>


<p class="hang1">Afternoon, two days later. The banquet hoard and oleanders have
been removed, every trace of the funeral has been carefully obliterated. Clear
sunlight comes in from the garden windows in the background and lights up the
spacious, sombre hall. The bushes and trees of the garden are coated with ice.
The fire is burning as usual. Toward the end of the act the sunlight gradually
vanishes and a light, gray dusk fills the hall. <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>
stands at the fireplace with her arms folded over her waist, and looks into the
fire.</p>
<br>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (who has been pacing the floor,
stops and passes his hand over his hair nervously). So no letter has come, Aunt
Clara?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (looking up). No, no, my
boy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (impatiently). And no messenger
either?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. From where do you expect
one?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (in agony). Great God, from where?
From where? From anywhere? Some tiding! Some word! A letter! (Paces the floor
again excitedly.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why I can't tell. Are you
expecting anything from some source or other?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (impetuously). Would I be <i>
asking</i>, Aunt Clara?</p>
<p class="right">[Silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (violently agitated, partly to
himself). Incomprehensible! Incomprehensible! Two days without news! Two full
days!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (sadly). I do not comprehend
you either, my boy!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (takes a few steps without heeding
her). This stillness! This death-like stillness!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (sits down). Isn't it good,
when peace prevails?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. As you look at it. Certainly it
is good! But first of all one must be at peace himself! Must have become calm
and clear about the matters that concern one. Know what one wants to do and is
expected to do and what one is here for in this world.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. But every one knows that,
Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (without listening to her, rather
to himself). Uncanny, this silence all around one. Doubly and three-fold one
feels, how it seethes and boils within, without one's getting anywhere. One can
hear himself
<i>think</i>! (He stops, then in a changed voice, as he looks up.) No no, Aunt
Clara, people who have closed their account, belong in the country. Others do
not! (<span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> looks at him and is silent. After a
moment.) The rest need noise, diversion, human beings about them. One
<i>must</i> have something in order <i>to be able to</i> forget! Some narcotic
to put one to sleep! There <i>are</i> people, who do that all of their lives and
are quite, happy, who never come to themselves, are continually living in a kind
of intoxication and leave this world without attaining real consciousness. You
see, Auntie, the city is the proper place for that. There you can dull your
feelings and forget.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I could not stand the city.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, you, Aunt Clara! You are a
child of the country.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Well, aren't you, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. True! But you have never been
alienated from the soil! I tell you the man who has once partaken of that
poison, can not give it up, he is forced to go back to it again and again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (impatiently). One simply
can't understand you, Paul. When you arrived, you said one thing and now you are
saying another. The very idea!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (is forced to smile). You fail to
understand that, you good old soul! Of course, you do not know what has come to
pass since then. At that time I was not at odds with myself ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. At that time! When, pray
tell? You came on the third holiday and this is New Year's eve. You have been
here for five days.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Today it's quite a different
matter. Quite different!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. What on earth has <i>
happened</i>, pray tell!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Much, much, Aunt Clara!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (probing). I suppose because
they were a bit boisterous at the funeral! That's the way of it, you know, when
they get to drinking.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (negative gesture). Good heavens,
no!... No!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. That's the way they <i>
always</i> act at funerals. I know of funerals where there was dancing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, yes, that may be!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. And then they all were so
friendly with you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Oh, yes. With the friendliest
kind of an air, they told me not to take it into my head that I know how to
farm.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why, Paul. You only imagine
that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. The good neighbors. At bottom
they are right! How should an old man be able to learn the things that call for
the efforts of a whole life, just as any other career does! Ridiculous! Why that
simply must have lurid consequences.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (impatiently). I should
never have thought that you would act this way, Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Act what way? I am only checking
over the possibilities. Every business man does that! And I tell you, the
prospects are desperately bad! I can fairly see Laskowski establish himself here
after I have lost the place! (He has slowly walked over to the garden window on
the right and looks out into the garden.)</p>
<p class="right">[Silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (after a time). What a beautiful
day! The snow is glittering in the sunlight. The trees stand so motionless.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Awfully cold out-doors, my
boy!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I know it. Aunt Clara, but the
light is refreshing after all of the dark days. The old year is shining forth
once more in its full glory.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. The days are getting longer
again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (meditating). Didn't you tell me,
once upon a time, Auntie, that the time between Christmas and New Year is called
the holy season?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. The time between Christmas
and Epiphany, Paul. If anyone dies then ... (She suddenly stops.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (calmly). Finish it, Aunt Clara!
If some one dies then, another member of the family will follow him. Isn't that
the purport?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Why Paul, I don't know!
Purport of what? Who would believe in all of those things?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Of course not! [Brief silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (with her hand behind her
ear). Do you hear the whips crack, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (also listens). Faintly, yes. It
seems to be out in front.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. The young folks are lashing
the old year out. They always do that on New Year's Eve when the sun goes down.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (reflecting). I know. I know. I
have heard it many a New Year's Eve. When the sun was setting.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Another one gone!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (stares out). Just so it stood
between the trees, and kept on sinking and sinking, and I was a little fellow
and watched it from the window. And at last it was down and twilight came on.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Thank God, Paul, this year
is over.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Who knows what the day may still
have in store for us! Things are taking their course.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Tonight we shall surely all
take punch together, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. If we have time and the desire to
do so, yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (nervously). How you <i>are</i>
talking, Paul! Don't make a person afraid!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (glancing at the sinking sun). Now
it is directly over the pavilion. Now we shall not enjoy it much longer. (With a
wave of his hand.) I greet thee, sun! Sinking sun!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I was going to ask you, in
regard to the pavilion ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (turns around). Yes I'm glad that
I've thought of it! (He comes forward and pulls the bell.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (opens the door at the right and
enters). Did you ring, sir?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes. My trunks, books, all of my
things are to be taken over to the garden-house. Understand?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (astonished). To the garden-house?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, to the pavilion. Put the
rooms in proper order. Don't forget to make a fire. I suppose there's a bed
there for the night?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Everything, my boy. Only it
will have to be put to rights, because no one has put up there this many a day.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Are the madam's things also to be
...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. No they are <i>not</i>! They are
to stay here!</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> shakes her head and turns
away.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Shall I do so immediately ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Is madam still asleep?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. I think so.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Then wait till madam is up, and
go there afterward.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. What if madam should ask ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Then tell her that I requested
you to do so.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (confused). I'm to say that Mr.
Warkentin has requested ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (resolutely). And you are to do
what I have requested. Do you understand me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. Very well, sir!... And I was
going to say, the inspector has been here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Has he? Back from town already?
(Struck by a sudden thought.) Did he possibly have a letter for me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. I don't know. I think he only
wanted to know about the work ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And there hasn't been a
messenger? Say, from Klonowken?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span>. No, nothing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Then you may go. Oh yes, when the
inspector returns, you might call me. (<span class="sc">Lene</span> goes off to
the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (walks through the hall, clenching
his fists nervously). Nothing yet? Nothing yet? And the day is almost gone!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (with growing anxiety).
What's the matter with you, Paul? Something is brewing here!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That may be very true!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. And then, that you insist
upon changing your quarters today! It does seem to me ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You can only take pleasure in
that. You see by that, that I have resolved to stay at Ellernhof. Or I should
certainly not go to the trouble.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Yes, yes, but your wife?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Who? Hella? All the better if the
matter comes to a head. The issue is dead ripe!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (approaches him anxiously).
Paul, Paul! This will not come to a good end.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Quite possible. That is not at
all necessary!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. And I am to blame for all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You? Why?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I got you into it! No one
else!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (is forced to smile). Innocent
creature! Individuals quite apart from you got me into it. It has taken a whole
lifetime to bring it about! You are as little to blame for that as you are for
the fall of Adam and the existence of the world and the fact that some day we
shall all have to die!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (with her apron before her
face). I told you about Antoinette! For she is at the bottom of it! I'll stake
my head on that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Don't torture me, Aunt Clara!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. She is at the bottom of it!
And I, in my stupidity, cap the climax by leaving the two of you alone at the
funeral day before yesterday.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I shall be grateful to you for
that all of my life, Aunt Clara!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. My notion was for you to
have a little talk together, and then to think what it has led to! May God
forgive what I have done.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (partly to himself). She promised
me to come. And she is not coming! She promised me to write. And she does not
write. Not a word. Not the remotest token! How do I know, but everything was a
delusion? Childish fancy and nothing more? The intoxication of a moment which
seized her and vanished again when she sat in her sleigh and rode away in the
winter night? Do I know? (He puts his hand to his head.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (very uneasy). Paul, what
are you talking about? <i>Tell</i> me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (jumps up without listening to
her). No!... Then farewell Ellernhof! Farewell my home and everything!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Do be quiet! What in the
world is the matter?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (walks up and down impatiently,
stops again, speaks to himself in an undertone). At that time I deceived her,
deceived her without knowing and wishing to. What if she deceives me now? What
if she pays me back? (He sinks down in the chair near the fireplace in violent
conflict with himself.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (in despair). What a
calamity! What a calamity!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (as if shaking something off). No!
No! No!... it cannot but come out right. (Heaves a sigh of relief.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (joyful again). Do you see,
my boy?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (gloomily). Don't rejoice
prematurely, Auntie! It seems to me that this house fosters misfortune! All that
you need to do is to look at those faces! They all have a suggestion of
melancholy and gloom. (He looks up at the portraits pensively.) Just as if the
sun had never shone into their hearts, you know. No air of hopefulness, no
suggestion of light and freedom! So chained to the earth! So savagely taciturn?
Can that be due to the air and soil? It will probably assert itself in me too,
after I have been here for some time. Possibly it would have been better,
Auntie, if I had never returned to this house! I should have continued that life
of mine, not cold, not warm, not happy, not unhappy! I should never have found
out what I have really missed and yet can never find. Possibly it would have
been better. [Short pause.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lene</span> (opens the door at the right and
stands in the door). The inspector is here, sir. Shall he come in? He is
lunching just now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (gets up). No, never mind. One
moment, Auntie! (He nods to her and goes out with <span class="sc">Lene</span>. )</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> shakes her head
apprehensively as she follows him with her eyes, heaves a deep sigh, occupies
herself with this and that in the room, then seems to be listening to a noise on
the left. She straightens up energetically. Presently the door on the left is
opened.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (enters, dressed in black. She
looks solemn and rather pale. She slowly approaches <span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>.
The two face each other and eye each other for a moment). I thought Paul was
here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Paul will surely be back
any minute.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Will he? Then I shall wait. (She
turns around and starts for the window.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (hesitates a moment, then
with a sudden effort). Madam ... Doctor ...? (Takes a step in the direction of <span class="sc">
Hella</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (looks around surprised). Were
you saying something?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (erect). Keep an eye on
Paul, madam!... That's all I have to say!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (approaches). How so?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. I am simply saying, keep an
eye on Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (steps up to her, with a
searching look). <i>What</i> is going on?...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>, Talk to him yourself. I
can't fathom it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Then I will tell you. Do you
think I am blind? Do you suppose that I am unable to see through the situation
here? I know Paul and I know you, all of you who are turning Paul's head!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (angered). Mercy me! <i>I</i>,
turn Paul's head!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, you, and all of you around
here! I will tell you to your face! You are trying to set Paul against me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (with increasing
excitement). I never set nobody against no one! Nobody ever said such a thing
about me! God knows! You are the first person to do that! And on top of it all,
I have the best intentions! I even want to help you! Well, I do say ...! (Takes
several steps through the hall.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with contemptuous laughter). You
help me?... H'm! You wanted to get rid of me, and that is why you started all
this about the estate, and staying here, and who knows <i>what</i> else. But I
declare to you, once and for all! Don't go to any trouble! You will not succeed
in parting Paul and me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (in spite of herself). May
be not I!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. <i>Not you</i>?... Oh indeed!...
Not you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (continuing in her anger).
No! Not I! Of course not! Even if you have deserved it, ten times over!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (also continues her lead). Not
you?... Well, well! So it's some other woman! (She steps up before <span class="sc">
Aunt Clara</span>. ) Some other woman is trying to separate us, Paul and me? Is
that it? Yes or no?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (frightened). I haven't said
a thing. I know nothing about it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (triumphantly). I thought so! And
now I grasp the whole situation!... That accounts for Paul's behavior, this
strange behavior! Well, well! (She walks to and fro excitedly, speaks partly to
herself.) But you shall not succeed! No, no! (Addressing <span class="sc">Aunt
Clara</span> again.) You shall not succeed! We'll just see who knows Paul
better, you or I!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (very seriously). Madam, I
am an old woman, you may believe me or not, I tell you, don't carry matters too
far with Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (reflecting again). So it was
she?... The Polish woman, of course! Didn't I know it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (almost threatening). Don't
carry matters too far! Remember what I say.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with a sudden change). Where is
Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (anxiously). What is the
matter?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (very calmly and firmly). I must
speak to Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span>. Merciful God! Now I see it
coming!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, I am going away and Paul is
going with me. That is the end of the whole matter. I suppose that is not just
exactly what you had expected.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (petrified). And you are
going to desert Ellernhof!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. It will be a long time before
the estate sees us again. Prepare for that. As for the rest, we shall see later.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (turns away). Then I might
as well order my grave at once, the sooner the better.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with an air of superiority).
Don't worry! You will be cared for.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (straightening up). Not a
soul needs to care for me henceforth, madam! My way is quite clear to me. It
will not be very long. Look at the men and women on these walls, they all
followed this course. Now I shall emulate their example. What is coming now is
no longer suitable for me. (She slowly steps to the door with head bowed).</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (partly to herself). No, what is
coming now is the new world and new men and women! (She stands and reflects for
a moment, then resolutely.) New men and women! Yes! Yes, we are ready to fight
for that! (She clasps her hands vigorously, suggesting inflexible resolution.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (enters from the right, comes upon <span class="sc">
Aunt Clara</span>, who is going out). What ails you, Auntie? How you do look!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Aunt Clara</span> (shakes her head). Don't ask
me, my boy. I have lived my life! (She goes out slowly and closes the door.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (steps to the fireplace pondering
deeply and drops down in a chair). What did she say?... Lived my life?... A
soothing phrase! A cradle-song! No more pain, no more care! All over!... Lived
my life! (Supports his head on his hand.)</p>
<p class="right">[Short pause.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (steps up to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>, lays her hand on his shoulder and says kindly). Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Be a man, Paul! I beg of you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looks up, with a deep breath).
That is just what I intend to do.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. For two days you have been
walking around without saying a word. That surely cannot continue.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That <i>will</i> not continue, I
am sure.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Why don't you speak? What have I
done to you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (bitterly). You to me?... Nothing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. See here, Paul, I stayed here on
your account, longer than I had intended and than seems justifiable to me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why did you? I did not ask you
again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Quite right. I did it of my own
accord. Now don't you think that counts for more, Paul? (She closely draws up a
chair and sits down facing <span class="sc">Paul</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Up to the day before yesterday <i>
anything</i> would have counted with me. Today no longer, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (eagerly). I remained because I
kept in mind that it might be agreeable to you to have me near you. I have given
you time to come to yourself again. I know very well what is going on in you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Hardly!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Indeed, Paul, indeed! You have
seen the soil of your boyhood home again. You have buried your father. I
understand your crisis completely.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Really! All at once!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. From the very beginning!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I did not realize very much of
it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (interrupting him). Simply
because I thought it would be best to let you settle that for yourself. That is
why I have not interfered; allowed you to go your own way, these days. (<span class="sc">Paul</span>
shrugs his shoulders and is silent.) Does all this fail to convince you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (distressed). Drop that, Hella.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (excited). What does this mean,
Paul! We must have an understanding!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That is no longer possible for
us, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. It certainly has been, up to the
present. How often we have quarreled in these years, and sailed into each other,
and we have always found our way back to each other again for the simple reason
that we belong together! Why in the world should that be impossible now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (struggles with himself; jumps
up). Because ... Because ... (Groping for words.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (has become calm). Well,
because?... Possibly because I did not care to stay down here, day before
yesterday, did not dine with your guests when you asked me to do so? Is that it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That and many other things.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (gets up). Paul, don't be petty!
I really can't bear to hear you talk in this manner. Are you so completely
unable to enter into my feelings? I could not share your sorrow. Your father did
not give me any occasion for that. I do not wish to speak ill of him, but I
cannot forget it. After all, that is only human!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. So the dead man stands between
us. Why don't you say so frankly!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. If you insist, yes. At least,
for the moment! I was not able to stay with you. I <i>had</i> to be alone.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Then blame yourself for the
consequences! You deserted me at a moment when simply everything was unsettling
me ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (interrupts him). Oh, you suppose
I don't know what you mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (excited). Well?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Shall I tell you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (controlling himself with
difficulty). Please!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (triumphantly). Dear Paul! Just
recall the lady with the ashy-blonde hair, for a moment!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (embarrassed). What lady?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Why, Paul? The one with whom I
saw you after the banquet, day before yesterday. Your aunt was there too, wasn't
she?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (affecting surprise). You seem to
refer to Madam von Laskowski.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (smiling). Quite right. The
Polish beauty! Was it not that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (beside himself). Hella?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (as before). Don't become
furious, Paul! There's no occasion at all for that! I am not reproaching you in
the least! On the contrary, I am of the opinion that you were quite right!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (comes nearer, plants himself
before her). What are you trying to say? What does all this mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with a very superior air). We
had quarreled, you were furious, wanted to revenge yourself, looked about for a
fitting object and naturally hit upon ... whom?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (turns away). Why it's simply
idiotic to continue answering such questions! (He walks through the hall
excitedly.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Hit upon whom?... With the kind
of taste that you do seem to have ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Hella, I object to that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Why, I am absolutely serious,
Paul! You can't expect me to question your taste! I should compromise my own
position. No, no, I really agree with you, of all those present she was
decidedly the most piquant. The typical beauty that appeals to men! Of course
you hit upon her, probably courted her, lavished compliments upon her, all the
things that you men do when you suppose that you are in the presence of an
inferior woman ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Hella, now restrain yourself! Or
I may tell you something ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Very well, let us even suppose
that you fell in love with her for the time and she with you, that you went into
ecstasy over each other and turned each other's heads, then you parted and the
next day the intoxication passed off, and, if not on the next day, then on the
following one ... Am I not right? Do you expect me to be jealous of such a thing
as that? No, Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (in supreme excitement, struggling
with himself). You are a demon! A demon!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (has become serious). I am your
friend, Paul! Believe me! I desire nothing but your own good, simply because I
care for you and because, I'll be frank with you, I should not want to lose you.
You may be convinced of it, Paul, conceited as it may sound, but you will never
find another woman like me! One with whom you can share everything! I don't know
what you may have said to the Polish woman or what she may have said to you, but
do you really suppose that she still knows about that today, even though the
most fervent vows were exchanged?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (jumps up). Hella, Hella, you do
not know what you are saying.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Would you teach me to know my
own sex? They aren't all like me, dear Paul. You have been spoiled by me. Very
few, indeed, have attained maturity as yet, or even know what they are doing.
You can depend upon very few of them. It seems to me that we are in the best
possible position to know that, Paul, after our years of work. And I am to fear
<i>such</i> competition? Expect me to be jealous of a Polish country beauty?
Me,&#8212;Hella Bernhardy!... No, Paul, I have been beyond that type of jealousy for
some time! (She walks up and down slowly.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (stands at the window, struggling
with himself). Would it not be better to say that you have <i>never</i> had it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Possibly! There are some who
consider that an advantage.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Theorists, yes! The kind that <i>
I</i> was, once upon a time. But now I know better! Now I know that the absence
of jealousy was nothing but an absence of love.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (energetically). That is not
true, Paul. I always cared for you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Cared! Cared! A fine word!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>, Why should you demand more than
that? I respected you, Paul, valued you as my best friend!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. All but a little word, a little
word ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. What is that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Imagine!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I know what you are thinking of!
I am not a friend of strong words, but if you insist upon hearing it, I have <i>
loved</i> you too!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You ... <i>me</i>!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, I have loved you, Paul, for
what you were, the unselfish idealist ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (bitterly). Oh, indeed!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, Paul! Do not forget about
one thing! I am not one of these petty little women, to whom men are the alpha
and omega! If you assumed that, of course you have been mistaken.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. To be sure! And the mistake has
cost me my life!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You knew it beforehand, Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Because I was blinded!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>, And yet I tell you, say what you
please, leave me for instance, but you will not find another woman who can
satisfy you after you have had me! I know it and will stake my life on it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Do you rate yourself so highly?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I am rating <i>you</i> highly,
Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (wavering). Do you mean to say I
am ruined for happiness?... Possibly you are right.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Whoever has once become
accustomed to the heights of life, will never again descend.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (repeats to himself). Will never
again descend.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You are too good for a woman of
the dead level! See here, Paul, I <i>have</i> at times made life a burden to
you, I now and then refused to enter upon many things just because my head was
full of ideas, possibly I have been too prone to disregard your emotional
nature.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Hella, do not remind me of that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. We must come to an
understanding, Paul! All of that may be true. And there <i>shall</i> be a
change. There <i>will</i> be a change, that much I promise you today, but show
me the kindness, pack your things and come with me! Today rather than tomorrow!
(She has stepped up to him and places her hands on his shoulders.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (in the most violent conflict).
Hella! Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Look into my face, Paul! Are you
happy here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (lowers his head). Do not ask me,
Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (triumphantly). Then you are not!
Didn't I know it? I am proud of you for that, Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (blurting out). Hella, do not
exult! I <i>cannot</i> go back again!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (undaunted). Yes you can! Are
these people here meant for you? Do you mean to say that you are suited to these
peasants? You, with your refined instincts? You would think of degrading
yourself consciously! Nobody can do that, you least of all! I tell you once
more, you are too good for these rubes!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, (frees himself from her). Give me
time till this evening, Hella! Then I will give you a full explanation!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (seizes his hand). Not thirty
minutes, Paul! You are to decide at once! As I have you at this moment, I shall
possibly never have you again. Pack your trunk and come with me! Have some one
manage the estate. We will go back tomorrow morning and begin the new life with
the new year. Thank your stars when you are once more out of this stuffy air. It
induces thoughts in you that can never make you happy. Say <i>yes</i>, Paul, say
that we are going!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has not listened to the last
words, listens to what is going on outside). Do you hear, Hella? (He frees
himself and goes to the foreground. One can hear people singing outside,
accompanied by a deep-toned instrument.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (impatiently). What in the world
is that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I have an idea, the people of the
estate, coming to proclaim Saint Sylvester, (The door at the right is opened.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (enters, makes a sign
suggesting silence, points toward the outside). Do you hear that instrument,
madam? That's what they call a pot harp, very interesting!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (as before). Interesting or not.
Why must you disturb us just now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (offended). If I had known
this, I should not have come! (About to go out.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (quite cold again). Stay right
here, dear Glyszinski! You haven't disturbed us up to the present! I do not see
that you are disturbing us now!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector</span> (comes in through the open
door). Sir, the people are outside with the pot harp and want to sing their
song.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (annoyed). Oh, tell them to go
and be done with it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (quickly). No, please, Hella, that
won't do. That is an old custom here on New Year's eve. Let them sing their
song. Besides, I like to hear it. I heard it many a time in my boyhood days.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector</span>. Shall I leave the door open,
sir?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Please! (He sits down at the
fireplace.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (steps up to him, with a voice
that betrays excitement). Paul, do not listen to that nonsense out there! Don't
let them muddle your head!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. My head is clearer than ever,
Hella! Don't go to any further trouble! I can see my way quite plainly now.</p>

<p class="hang1">
<span class="sc">Hella</span> (retreats to the sofa, embittered). And now that
old trumpery must interfere too!</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Inspector</span> stands at the door with <span class="sc">
Glyszinski</span>, motions to those outside. A brief silence, then singing to
the accompaniment of the pot harp. The lines run as follows:]</p>
<div style="margin-left:6em">
<p class="continue">We wish our dear lord<br>

            And at all four corners<br>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Will that continue much longer,
Paul?</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Paul</span> gets up, motions to the inspector
and goes out with him. The door is closed behind them. The muffled tones of the
pot harp and the singing can still be heard, but the text becomes
unintelligible. <span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>, who also has been listening
till now, starts to go out.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (from the sofa). One moment,
Doctor!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (absent-minded). Were you
calling me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Why, yes, now that you are here,
I might as well make use of the occasion.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (approaches, somewhat
reserved). What can I do for you, madam?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Dear friend, do not be startled.
We shall have to part.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (staggering). Part? We?...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (calmly). Yes, Doctor, it must
be!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Why, who compels us to? No
one!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (frigidly). My <i>decision</i>
compels us, dear friend! Is that sufficient for you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (whimpering). Your decision,
Hella? You are cruel.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, I myself am sorry, of
course. I shall probably miss you quite frequently!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (as before). Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Especially in connection with my
correspondence. You have certainly been a real help to me there. I shall have to
carry that burden alone again, now. But what is to be done about it? No other
course is possible. We must part.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. But why? At least, give me
a reason! Don't turn me out in this fashion.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. It is necessary on account of my
husband, dear friend! I must make this sacrifice for him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (raging). The monster! (He
paces through the hall wildly.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with clarity). You know, it
cannot be denied that Paul can't bear you, that he is always annoyed when he
sees you ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. Do you suppose the reverse
is not true?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, you men are exasperating.
No one can eradicate your jealousy! <i>That</i> makes an unconstrained
intercourse impossible! But what is to be done? Paul is my husband, <i>not you</i>.
And so I am compelled to request you to yield.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> (with his hands raised).
Kill me, Hella, but don't turn me out.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (wards him off). A pleasant
journey. <i>You</i> will be able to find comfort.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. I shall be alone, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (straightening up). All of us
are!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span>. May I ever see you again,
Hella?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Possibly later! And now go! I do
not care to have my husband find you here when he comes. Why here he is now.
(She pushes him over toward the right, the door has been opened and the singing
has ceased in the meantime.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has entered, sees Glyszinski,
frigidly). Are you still here? If you wish to talk together, I'll go out.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (comes over to <span class="sc">
Paul</span>). Please stay, Paul! </p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> has just been telling me
that he is going to take the night train back to Berlin and he is asking you for
a sleigh. Isn't that it, Doctor? (<span class="sc">Glyszinski</span> nods
silently, passes by <span class="sc">Paul</span> and goes out at the right.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (frigidly). What's the use of this
farce?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (places her hand on his
shoulder). Not a farce, Paul! It is really true! When we get to Berlin tomorrow
evening, you will no longer find Glyszinski at our rooms! Are you satisfied now?
Have I finally succeeded in pleasing you, you grumbler!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (turns away, clenching his fists
nervously). Oh, well!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Look into my face, Paul, old
comrade! Tell me if you are pleased with your comrade. (<span class="sc">Paul</span>
is silent.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (frowning). Now isn't that a
proof to you of my fidelity and sincerity?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Do not torment me, Hella. My
decision is final!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (worried). I don't know what you
mean! Surely the matter is settled. We are going, aren't we? (She looks at him
anxiously.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (frees himself from her). That is
not settled! I shall <i>remain</i>! [A moment of silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (furiously). You are going to
remain?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (curtly). I shall remain ... And
no power on earth will swerve me from my purpose! Not even you, Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (plants herself before him). Are
you trying to play the part of the stronger sex? Eye to eye, Paul! No evasions
now! Are you playing the farce of the stronger sex?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I do what I must do!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. What you must?... Well so must <i>
I</i>.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (bows his head). I know that, and
I am not hindering you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (reflects a moment, then). And do
you realize that that practically means separation for us?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I have already told you, Hella, I
am prepared for anything.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (looks at him sharply; with quick
decision). And what if I stay also, Paul, what then?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. (is startled). If you also ...?
You are not serious about that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Assume that I am!... If I should
remain also, for your sake? (She stands before him erectly.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (furiously). Don't jest, Hella! It
is not the proper moment!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I am certainly not jesting! I am
your wife! I shall keep you company. <i>Aren't</i> you pleased with that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (straightens up). The dead man
stands between us, as you have said. Very well, let that be final! You have
wished it so! The bond between us is broken. We have come to the parting of our
ways. (He goes to the left, opens the door and walks out slowly. Deep twilight
has set in.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (stands rigidly and whispers to
herself). To the parting of our ways? (Waking up, with a wild defiance.) If I <i>
consent</i>, I say!... If I consent!</p>

<p class="hang1">A room in the garden house. The door in the background leads
out-doors. There are windows at both sides of the door and also in the right
wall. They all look out upon the garden, but are draped with long, heavy
curtains. On the left a door leads into the bedroom. On the same side farther
back a tile stove. A divan, table and chair, very near the stove. Bookshelves
along the walls. The general impression is that of simple comfort.</p>

<p class="hang1">It is evening, a short time after the preceding act. A lamp is
burning on the table and lights up the no more than fair-sized cozy room.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> appears in the open
door at the background. Before him stands <span class="sc">Paul</span>. </p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. As I was saying, have the bay
saddled in case I should still want to take a ride.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. Very well, sir!
Immediately?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. In about thirty minutes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. Shall the coachman
bring out the bay or will you come to the stable?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Have it brought out! Good-by. (He
comes back into the room.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. Good night, sir! (He
withdraws and closes the door behind him.)</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Paul</span> walks up and down excitedly
several times. He seems to be in a violent struggle with himself, sometimes
listens for something outside, shakes his head, groans deeply, finally throws
himself on the divan and crosses his arms under his head. Short pause.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (opens the door in the
background, enters and looks around). Are you here, Paul? (She has thrown a
shawl around her.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (jumps up, disappointed). Hella,
you? (Sits down.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (approaches). Yes, it is I,
Hella! Who else? Were you expecting some one else?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (painfully). Why do you still
insist upon coming? Don't make it unnecessarily hard for both of us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (calmly). I am waiting for an
explanation from you. Since you will not give it to me of your own accord, I am
compelled to get it. It seems to me I have a right to claim it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You certainly have.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with folded arms). Please, then!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Hella, what is the purpose of
this? You do know everything now!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I know nothing. I should like to
find out from you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (gets up). Very well, then I will
tell you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I assume that the Polish woman
is mixed up in this affair.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. So you do know! Why in the world
are you going to the trouble of asking me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. So it's really true? I am to
stand aside for a little goose from the country!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>(starts up). A little goose from
the country?... Hella, control your tongue!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (walks up and down). If it were
not so ridiculous, it would be exasperating!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. The woman under discussion is not
a little goose from the country, my dear, just as little as you are one from the
city.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Thank you for your flattering
comparison.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That woman has had her struggles
and trials as much as you have, and in spite of it has remained a woman, which <i>
you</i> have <i>not</i>!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (scornfully). Well, well. Are you
now asserting your real nature? Are you throwing off the mask? Go on! Go on!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (controls himself with an effort).
That is all! I am only standing up for one who is dear to me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Ha, ha! Dear! Today and
tomorrow!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You are mistaken, Hella! I
believe in Antoinette, and I shall not swerve from that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with a sudden inspiration).
Antoinette ... Antoinette ... Why that name ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Let me assist you, Hella.
Antoinette is the friend of my youth ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (nonplussed). The friend of your
youth?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, Indeed, Hella, I have known her
longer than I have known you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. The one whom you were to marry
once upon a time? Is it she?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (sadly). Whom I was to marry, whom
I refused on your account, Hella.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You met <i>her</i> again here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. As Mrs. von Laskowski, yes,
Hella!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (starts for him, with a savage
expression). And you kept that from me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Why you did not give me a chance
to speak, when I tried to tell you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. So that was the confidence you
had! Well, of course, then, of course!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Oh, my confidence, Hella! Don't
mention that. That had died long before!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. To be deceived so shamefully.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Blame yourself! You have killed
it systematically!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I? What else, pray tell!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Yes, by forever considering only
yourself and never me! That could not help but stifle all my feelings in time. I
fought against it as long as I could, Hella, but it had to come to an end some
time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. And I went about without
misgivings, while behind my back a conspiracy was forming ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (shrugging his shoulders). Who
conspired?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. All of you! This whole owl's
nest of a house was in league against me! You had conspired against me, you and
your ilk, simply because I was superior to you, that's the reason why you wanted
to shoulder me off! Do you suppose I don't realize that? Very well, let baseness
prevail! I am willing to retreat!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. It always has been your trick,
Hella, to play the part of offended innocence! It is well that you are reminding
me of that in this hour! You are making the step easier for me than I had hoped.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. This is the thanks!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Thanks!... How in the world could
you expect thanks?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with infuriated hatred). Because
I made a <i>human being</i>
of you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (starting up). Hella, you are
making use of <i>words</i>!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (beside herself). Yes, made a <i>
human</i> being of you. I will repeat it ten times over!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Won't you kindly call in the
whole estate with your shrieking.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. The whole world, for all I care!
What were you when you came into my hands? A crude student, utterly helpless,
whom I directed into the proper channels, <i>I</i>, single handed! Without me
you would have gone to the dogs or you might have become one of those novelists
whom no one reads! I was the first one to put sound ideas in your head, roused
your talent and pointed out to you all that is really <i>demanded</i>. Through
me you attained a name and reputation, and now that you are fortunate enough to
be that far along, you go and throw yourself away upon a Polish goose, you ...
you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (as if under a lash). There are
limits to all things, Hella, even to consideration for your sex! Do not assume
that you still have me in your power. It has lasted fifteen years. It is over
today. Do you suppose I ought to thank you for sapping everything from me, my
will-power, my strength, my real talents, all the faith in love and beauty that
was once in me, which you have systematically driven out with your infernal
leveling process? Where shall I ever find a trace of all that again? I might
seek for a hundred years and not strike that path again! I might have become an
artist, at life or art itself, who cares! And you have made me a beggar, a
machine, that reels off its uniform sing-song day after day! You have cheated me
out of my life, you imp!... Give it back to me! (He stands before her, breathing
heavily, struggling for air.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (has become quite calm). Why did
you <i>allow</i> yourself to be cheated. It's your own fault!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (suddenly calm, but sad and
resigned). That is a profound word, Hella! Why have you ... <i>allowed</i> ...
yourself to be cheated!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You had your will-power just as
I had mine. Why did you not make use of it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. <i>You</i>, with your ideas,
would say <i>that</i>, Hella?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Yes, <i>one</i> or the other is
stronger, of course! Why should we women not be stronger?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (turns away). That is sufficient,
Hella. We are through with each other. There is nothing more to say.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. As you may decide. So it is
really all over between us?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (stands in deep thought and
murmurs to himself). Why did you
<i>allow</i> yourself to be cheated? Terrible! Terrible! Why must this
conviction come too late?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (in a lurking manner). I suppose
you are going to the other woman now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (breathes a deep sigh of relief).
We are going together!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (with a sudden inspiration). If I <i>
release</i> you, you mean!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (quite calmly). I suppose you will
be <i>compelled</i> to!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (triumphantly). Who can compel
me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (starts up). Hella, then ... Then
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Well? Then?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (controls himself, with a strange
expression). Then we shall see who is the stronger. (The door in the background
has been opened.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (has entered quickly, starts
at seeing <span class="sc">Hella</span>, stops in the background and sags, in a
subdued voice). Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (turns around frightened, exclaims
passionately). Antoinette! (He rushes up to her, about to embrace her. She turns
him aside gently and looks at <span class="sc">Hella</span>. The two press each
other's hands firmly and look into each other's eyes.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (softly). I am here, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Thank you, thank you, dear!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (has recovered from her
astonishment and starts for Antoinette, savagely). Who <i>are</i> you, and what
do you want here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (steps between them, very
seriously). Hella ... If you please ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (restrains <span class="sc">
Paul</span>, with a quiet, distinguished bearing). I am not afraid, Paul. Just
continue, madam.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (furiously). Who has given you
the right to intrude here?</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Paul</span> has retreated a little in
response to <span class="sc">Antoinette's</span>
        entreating glance.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Ask yourself, madam. Who
was here earlier, you or I?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (turns away abruptly). I shall
not quarrel with you, I shall simply show you the door!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Well, well. We are standing on <i>
my</i> soil now, Hella! Remember that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (infuriated). Oh, I suppose you
are insisting upon your rights!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, Why I simply must. You are
forcing me to do so!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Very well. I am doing that very
thing!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (clenches his fists). Really now!
You will not change your mind?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I will not change my mind. I
shall not release you. Now do as you please!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You will not release me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. No!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>, (beside himself). You!... You!...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Be quiet, dear! No mortal
can interfere with us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. How affectionate! You probably
suppose that you have him
<i>already</i>? That I shall simply go and your happiness is complete! Don't
deceive yourself! You shall not enjoy happiness when I am compelled to battle.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Did I not battle?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Your little battle. Simply
because you did not happen to get the man that you wanted! We have had battles
of quite other dimensions!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Do not believe for a moment
that you have a right to look down upon me! I shall pick up your gauntlet in the
things that really count.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. You? My gauntlet? Ha, ha!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. You <i>too</i> are only a
woman, just as I am, and although you may rate yourself ever so much higher, you
will remain a woman nevertheless!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Woman or not! I shall show you
with whom you have to deal! I shall not retreat and that settles it! Under the
law, you shall never get each other. Now show your courage.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I shall show you my
courage!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. Dare to do so without the law!
Bear the consequences! Suffer yourself to be cast out by all the world! Have
them point their fingers at you! That is the absconded wife who is living with a
run-away husband! Take that ban upon you! Do you see now? <i>I</i> should. I
should scorn the whole world! Can you do the same?</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> bows her head and is
silent.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span> (triumphantly). You can't do
that! I knew it very well.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (composed). What I can and
what I cannot do is in the hand of God. That is all that I have to say to you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. That is all I need to know! I
wish you a happy life!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has been restraining himself,
steps up to <span class="sc">Hella</span>). Hella, one last word!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. It has been spoken!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Do you remember what we agreed to
do once upon a time?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I don't remember anything now!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Hella, remember! On our wedding
day we agreed, if either one of us, from an honest conviction, should demand his
freedom, he should have it, our compact should be ended. That occasion is here.
Remember!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. I don't remember a thing now. <i>
You</i> certainly do not.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Don't say another word,
dear!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Hella</span>. It would certainly do no good!
Good-by! As for the rest, we shall see!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. We shall.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Hella</span> goes out with head erect and
closes the door behind her. Pause. <span class="sc">Paul</span> and <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span> stand face to face for a moment and look into each other's
eyes.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (morosely). Now the bridges are
burned behind us!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. They are, dear. Do you
realize it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. What now? What now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (sinks upon his breast).
Paul! My Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (embraces her, presses her to him
fervently. They embrace in silence, then he draws her down beside him on the
divan, and looks at her affectionately). It was a long time before you came,
Toinette.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. But now I am here, and
shall leave you no more.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You will not leave me, beloved?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I shall never leave you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And I shall not leave you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. And you will not leave me.
(They embrace each other.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (straightens up). Why did you stay
so long, Toinette?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Much was to be set in
order, dear.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I was almost beginning to doubt
you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. You wicked man. Then I
should have been forced to go alone.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Alone? Where would you have gone,
you poor, helpless, little soul</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Do not think that! I have
the thing that will help me. That is why I am so late!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (shrinking). Antoinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (smiling). Don't be
frightened, dear! Two drops and all is over.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (has risen). You would?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (gently). Yes, I will. Are
you going with me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Toinette! Toinette! (Walks
through the room excitedly.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Think of her words, she
will not release you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Is Hella right? You <i>haven't</i>
the courage?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (passionately). Courage I
have, Paul. To the very end!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Very well, then we shall
undertake it in spite of them all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (excited). The absconded
wife! The runaway husband! Did you forget those words? Those terrible words!
They keep on ringing in my ears. Are we to live in the scorn of people. I
cannot, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. You do not <i>want</i> to.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. No, I <i>do</i> not want
to! I do not care to descend into the mire! I have hated it all of my life. They
shall not be able to reproach us for anything.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (in passionate excitement). Is it
to be? Is it to be? (<span class="sc">Antoinette</span>nods silently).</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (suddenly overcome with emotion,
falls upon his knees before
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> and presses his head to her bosom). Kiss me,
kiss me, beloved!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (puts her arms around him).
Here on your brow, my lover! Are you content? (She kisses his brow.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Content in life or death. (He
gets up, sits down beside
<span class="sc">Antoinette</span> and looks at her). Are you weeping,
sweetheart?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (lowers her head, gently).
Why, you are, too, Paul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (passes his hand over his eyes).
All over! Tell me what you think now, dear!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (also controlling her
tears). It is this, dear, our time is short. I rode away from my husband! He was
riding ahead of me in the sleigh. I had told him that I would follow and I
mounted my horse and came to you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (puts his arms around her).
Courageous soul! Rode through the forest?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Right on through the
forest. The sun was already going down, when I set out.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. The sun of New Year's Eve ... Did <i>
you</i> see it too?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. When it was down, the
gloaming afforded me light, and later the snow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (sadly with a touch of
roguishness). Dearest, when the sun is down, there is nothing left to give
light.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Indeed, my beloved, indeed!
Then come the stars. They are finer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Do you believe in the stars?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. You heretic, I believe!...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Still believe in heaven and hell?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. No longer for us. For us,
the stars.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Do you think so? For us?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. For us and lovers such as
we are!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Since I have you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Then I believe it too!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. My friend! My beloved! My
life! (She presses him to her.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. My beloved! My wife! [Blissful
silence.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (straightens up). Don't you
hear steps? (She listens.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (also listens). Where, pray tell.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (has risen). Out in the
garden. It seemed so to me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I hear nothing. All is still.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (leans upon him). I am
afraid, Paul.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Afraid? Of what?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. That he will come and get
me. Our time is short.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Then I will protect you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Paul, I don't want to see
him again! I don't want to see another soul!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looks at her with glowing eyes).
How beautiful you are now, Toinette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Am I beautiful? Am I
beautiful. For you, my Paul, for you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. For me. (He puts his arms around
her.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (proudly). I am still
beautiful and young and yet I shall cast it away. I am not afraid.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (his arms about her). We are not
afraid!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Out into night and death
together with you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. It is not worth living! We have
realized that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (looks up at him, smiling).
Haven't we, Paul, we two lost creatures? (In each other's embrace, they are
silent for a moment.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (roguishly). Do you
remember, dear, what you used to do when you were a little boy?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. No, sweetheart, tell me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Try to recall, dear. What
did you do when your mother gave us bread and cake.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. I took the bread first, is that
what you mean, and then finished up with the cake.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (shakes her finger at him).
Kept the cake for the end, you crafty fellow!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (is forced to laugh). Kept the
best part for the end! Yes that's what I did.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (on his breast). Just wait,
you rogue. Now I'll make you answer. Tell me, what am <i>I</i> now, bread or
cake!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. My last, my best, my all, that's
what you are to me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. There can be no joy beyond
this. Shall we become old and gray and withered? Come, my dear, come!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (looks at her for a long time). Do
you know of what you remind me now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Of what, Paul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. That is just the way you stood in
our park when you were a girl, out there under the alders, and beckoned to me
when you wanted me to come and play with you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (beckoning roguishly). Come
on, Paul. Come on. Isn't that it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Just so! Just so!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Catch me, Paulie!... Catch
me! (She runs to the left, opens the door and remains standing.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (runs after her and seizes her).
Now I have you, you rogue?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (in his arms). Have me and
hold me fast!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. New Year's Eve! New Year's
Eve!... Is it here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. It's no longer necessary
for us to cast lead to find out how long we are to live. We know!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Soon we shall know nothing!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Soon we shall know all!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. On your stars, do you mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (nods). On our star, my
lover, you and I shall meet again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. There we shall meet again!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (starts, and listens). Do
you hear?</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> opens the door in the
background and stands in the door. <span class="sc">Paul</span> and <span class="sc">
Antoinette</span> let go of each other, keeping their places.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. The bay is bridled,
sir, and stands out here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (has an inspiration). The
bay bridled? Is my gray there, too?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span>. It is, madam!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. Very well. Stay with the
horses. We shall be there immediately!</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Inspector Zindel</span> withdraws.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (astonished). What is it, dear?
What do you intend to do?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (with frantic passion). To
our horses, dearest! To our horses!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (incredulously). Out into the
world, after all?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (with a wild fervor). Out
with you into the night ... the night of Saint Sylvester!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (sadly). Stay here, Toinette! Why
begin the farce anew! Let it end upon this soil, that nurtured our childhood!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span> (imploring). Come, dearest,
to our horses! Let us ride to my home.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. To your home?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. To Rukkoschin, the house of
my fathers.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Do you wish to go there?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. I wish to see it once more!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. And then we shall be ready?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. The house lies secluded and
empty and dead.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span>. Only the spirits of your fathers
are stirring.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. But I know of one room
where I played as a child, that has suffered no change.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (overcome). To our horses! To our
horses!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Antoinette</span>. The night is clear. Many
thousands of stars will light the way. We shall ride through the forest. Right
across the lake. The ice is firm.</p>
<p class="right">[She draws him out.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Paul</span> (with a gesture toward the
outside). Farewell, Hella! Your reign is over!... We are returning to Mother
Earth! (They depart through the door in the background.)</p>

<h2>THE MARRIAGE OF SOBEIDE (1899)</h2>

<br>

<h2>SCENE I</h2>


<p class="hang1">Sleeping chamber in the house of the wealthy <span class="sc">
Merchant</span>. To the rear an alcove with dark curtains. To the left a door,
to the right a small door leading into the garden, and a window. Candles.</p>

<p class="center">Enter the <span class="sc">Merchant</span> and his old
Servant, <span class="sc"><span class="sc">BAHRAM</span>. </span> </p>




<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>Speak, Bahram, gav'st thou
heed unto my bride?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>Heed, in what sense!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br> She is not cheerful,
Bahram.</p>



<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>  She is a serious girl.
And 'tis a moment<br>
           That sobers e'en the flightiest, remember.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>Not she alone: the more I
bade them kindle<br>
           Lights upon lights, the heavier hung a cloud<br>
           About this wedding-feast. They smiled like masks,<br>
           And I could catch the dark or pitying glances<br>
           They flung to one another; and her father<br>
           Would oft subside into a dark reflection,<br>
           From which he roused himself with laughter forced,<br>
           Unnatural.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>             My Lord, our
common clay<br>
           Endureth none too well the quiet splendor<br>
           Of hours like these. We are but little used<br>
           To aught but dragging through our daily round<br>
           Of littleness. And on such high occasions<br>
           We feel the quiet opening of a portal<br>
           From which an unfamiliar, icy breath<br>
           Our spirit chills, and warns us of the grave.<br>
           As in a glass we then behold our own<br>
           Forgotten likeness come into our vision,<br>
           And easier 'twere to weep than to be merry.</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  She tasted not a morsel
that thou placed<br>
           Before her.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>               Lord, her
modest maidenhood<br>
           Was like a noose about her throat; but yet<br>
           She ate some of the fruit.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
Yes, one small seed,<br>
           I noticed that, 'twas a pomegranate seed.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>  Then too she suddenly
bethought herself<br>
           That wine, a blood-red flame in sparkling crystal,<br>
           Before her stood, and raised the splendid goblet<br>
           And drank as with a sudden firm resolve<br>
           The half of it, so that the color flooded<br>
           Her cheeks, and deep she sighed as with relief.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  Methinks that was no
happy resolution.<br>
           So acts the man who would deceive himself,<br>
           And veils his glance, because the road affrights him.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>  Vain torments these: this
is but women's way.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span> (looks about the room,
smiles).<br>
           A mirror, too, I see thou hast provided.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>  Thine own command, the
mirror is thy mother's,<br>
           Brought hither from her chamber with the rest.<br>
           And thou thyself didst bid me, just this one ...</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  What, did I so? It was a
moment, then,<br>
           When I was shrewder than I am just now.<br>
           Yes, yes, a youthful bride must have a mirror.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>  Now I will go to fetch
your mother's goblet<br>
           And bring the cooling evening drink.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
Ah yes,<br>
           Go, my good Bahram, fetch the evening drink.
<p class="right">[Exit <span class="sc">BAHRAM</span>. ]</p>
<p style="margin-left:7em;">Thou mirror of my mother, dwells no glimmer<br>
           In thee of her sweet pallid smile, to rise<br>
           As from the dewy mirror of a well-spring?<br>
           Her smile, the faintest, loveliest I have known,<br>
           Was like the flutter of a tiny birdling,<br>
           That sleeps its last upon the hollowed hand.
<p class="right">[Stands before the mirror.]</p>
<p style="margin-left:7em;">No, naught but glass. Too long it empty stood.<br>
           Only a face that does not smile&#8212;my own.<br>
           My Self, beheld with my own eyes, so vacant<br>
           As if one glass but mirrored forth another,<br>
           Unconscious.&#8212;Oh for higher vision yet,<br>
           For but one moment infinitely brief,<br>
           To see how stands upon <i>her</i> spirit's mirror<br>
           My image! Is't an old man she beholds?<br>
           Am I as young as oft I deem myself,<br>
           When in the silent night I lie and listen<br>
           To hear my blood surge through its winding course?<br>
           Is it not being young, to have so little<br>
           Of rigidness or hardness in my nature?<br>
           I feel as if my spirit, nursed and reared<br>
           On nourishment so dreamlike, bloodless, thin,<br>
           Were youthful still. How else should visit me<br>
           This faltering feeling, just as in my boyhood,<br>
           This strange uneasiness of happiness,<br>
           As if 'twould slip each moment from my hands<br>
           And fade like shadows? Can the old feel this?<br>
           No, old men take the world for something hard<br>
           And dreamless; what their fingers grasp and hold,<br>
           They hold. While <i>I</i> am even now a-quiver<br>
           With all this moment brings; no youthful monarch<br>
           Were more intoxicated, when the breezes<br>
           Should waft to him that cryptic word &quot;possession.&quot;</p>
<p class="right">[He nears the window.]</p>
<p style="margin-left:7em;">Ah, lovely stars, are ye out there as ever?<br>
           From out of this unstable mortal body<br>
           To look upon your courses in your whirling<br>
           Eternal orbits&#8212;that has been the food<br>
           That bore with ease my years, until I thought<br>
           I scarcely felt my feet upon the earth.<br>
           And have I really withered, while my eyes<br>
           Clung to yon golden suns, that do not wither?<br>
           And have I learned of all the quiet plants,<br>
           And marked their parts and understood their lives,<br>
           And how they differ when upon the mountains,<br>
           Or when by running streams we find them growing,&#8212;<br>
           Almost a new creation, yet at bottom<br>
           A single species; and with confidence<br>
           Could say, this one does well, its food is pure,<br>
           And lightly bears the burden of its leaves,<br>
           But this through worthless soil and sultry vapors<br>
           Has thickened stems, and bloated, swollen leaves ...<br>
           And more ... and of myself I can know nothing,<br>
           And heavy scales are crusted on my eyes,<br>
           Impeding judgment ...</p>
<p class="hang5">[He hastily steps before the mirror again.]</p>
<p class="hang4">Soulless tool!<br>
           Not like some books and men caught unawares:<br>
           Thou never canst reveal the hidden truth<br>
           As in a lightning flash.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span> (returning).<br>
           My master.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
Well?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>  The guests depart. The
father of thy bride<br>
           And others have been asking after thee.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  And what of her?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Servant</span>. <br>               She takes
leave of her parents.</p>
<p class="hang5">[<span class="sc">Merchant</span> stands a moment with staring<br>
              eyes, then goes out at the door to the left<br>
              with long strides. <span class="sc">Servant</span> follows him.<br>
              The stage remains empty for a short time.<br>
              Then the <span class="sc">Merchant</span> reënters, hearing a<br>
              candelabrum which he places on the table<br>
              beside the evening drink. <span class="sc">Sobeide</span> enters<br>
              behind him, led by her father and mother.<br>
              All stop in the centre of the room, somewhat<br>
              to the left, the <span class="sc">Merchant</span> slightly removed<br>
              from the rest. <span class="sc">Sobeide</span> gently releases<br>
              herself. Her veil hangs down behind her.<br>
              She wears a string of pearls in her hair,<br>
              a larger one about her neck.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Father</span>. <br>    From much in life I have
been forced to part.<br>
           This is the hardest. My belovéd daughter,<br>
           This is the day which I began to dread<br>
           When still I saw thee smiling in thy cradle,<br>
           And which has been my nightmare o'er and o'er.<br>
<p class="center">(To the <span class="sc">Merchant</span>. )</p>
           <p class="hang4">Forgive me. She is more to me than child.<br>
           I give thee that for which I have no name,<br>
           For every name comprises but a part&#8212;<br>
           But she was everything to me!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
Dear father,<br>
           My mother will be with thee.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mother</span>  (gently).<br>
Cross him not:<br>
           He is quite right to overlook his wife.<br>
           I have become a part of his own being,<br>
           What strikes me, strikes him too; but what I do<br>
           Affects him only as when right and left<br>
           Of his own body meet. Meanwhile, however,<br>
           The soul remains through all its days a nursling,<br>
           And reaches out for breasts more full of life,<br>
           Farewell. Be no worse helpmeet than I was,<br>
           And mayst thou be as happy too. This word<br>
           Embraces all.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
Embrace&#8212;that is the word;<br>
           Till now my fate was in your own embraced,<br>
           But now the life of this man standing here<br>
           Swings wide its gates, and in this single moment<br>
           I breathe for once the blessed air of freedom:<br>
           No longer yours, and still not his as yet.<br>
           I beg you, go; for this unwonted thing,<br>
           As new to me as wine, has greater power,<br>
           And makes me view my life and his and yours<br>
           With other eyes than were perhaps befitting.</p>

           Such notions oft go flitting through my head,<br>
           Nor dream nor yet reality. Ye know,<br>
           As child I was much worse. And then the dance<br>
           Which I invented, is't not such a thing:<br>
           Wherein from torchlight and the black of night<br>
           I made myself a shifting, drifting palace,<br>

just at first perhaps<br>
           Thou mayst lack much. This house, since mother's death,<br>
           Has grown disused to serve a woman's needs.<br>
           And our utensils here do not display<br>

           Half took my breath, I had all these removed<br>
           And placed there in thy chamber for thy service,<br>
           Where something of my mother's presence still&#8212;<br>
           Forgive me&#8212;seems to cling. I thought in this<br>
           To show and teach thee something ... On some things<br>
           There are mute symbols deeply stamped, with which<br>
           The air grows laden in our quiet hours,<br>
           And fuses something with our consciousness<br>
           That could not well be said, nor was to be.</p>
<p class="right">[Pause.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">It hurts me when I see thee thus, benumbed<br>
           By all these overladen moments, that<br>
           Scarce walk upright beneath their heavy burden.<br>
           But let me say, all good things enter in<br>
           Our souls in quiet unpretentious ways,<br>
           And not with show and noise. One keeps expecting<br>
           To see Life suddenly appear somewhere<br>
           On the horizon, like a new domain,<br>
           A country yet untrodden. Yet the distance<br>
           Remains unpeopled; slowly then our eyes<br>
           Perceive its traces ling'ring here and yonder,<br>
           And that it compasses, embraces us,<br>
           And bears us, is in us, and nowhere fails us.<br>
           The words I say can give thee little pleasure,<br>
           Too much renunciation rings in them.<br>
           But not to me, by Heaven! My sweet child,<br>
           Not like a beggar do I feel before thee,</p>
<p class="center">(With a long look at her.)</p>
           <p class="hang4">However fair thy youth's consummate glory<br>
           Envelop thee from top to toe ... thou knowest<br>
           Not much about my life, thou hast but seen<br>
           A fragment of its shell, as dimly gleaming<br>
           In shadows through the op'nings of a hedge.<br>
           I wish thine eye might pierce the heart of it:<br>
           As fully as the earth beneath my feet<br>
           Have I put from me all things low and common.<br>
           Callst thou that easy, since I now am old?<br>
           'Tis true, I've lost some friends by death ere this&#8212;<br>
           And thou at most thy grandam&#8212;many friends,<br>
           And those that live, where are they scattered now?<br>
           To them was linked the long forgotten quiver<br>
           Of nights of youth, those evening hours in which<br>
           Vague fear with monstrous, sultry happiness<br>
           Was mingled, and the perfume of young locks<br>
           With darkling breezes wafted from the stars.</p>
<hr class="W10">
           <p class="hang4">The glamor of the motley towns and cities,<br>

           Nor could be found, though I should go to seek it;<br>
           But here within me, when I call, there rises<br>
           A something, rules my spirit, and I feel<br>
           As if it might in thee as well&#8212;</p>
<p class="right">[He changes his tone.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">Knowst thou the day, on which thou needst must dance<br>
           Before thy father's guests? A smile unfading<br>
           Dwelt on thy lips, than any string of pearls<br>
           More fair, and sadder than my mother's smile,<br>
           Which thou hast ne'er beheld. This is to blame:<br>
           That smile and dance were interlaced, like wondrous<br>
           Fingers of dreamlike possibilities.<br>
           Wouldst thou they ne'er had been, since they're to blame,<br>
           My wife, that thou art standing here with me?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (in such a tone that her voice
is heard<br>

           Commandest thou that I should dance? If not,<br>
           Commandest thou some other thing?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
My wife,<br>
           How wild thou speakest with me, and how strangely!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   Wild? Hard, perhaps: my
fate is none too soft.<br>
           Thou speakest as a good man speaks, then be<br>
           So good as not to speak with me today.<br>
           I am thy chattel, take me as thy chattel,<br>
           And let me, like a chattel, keep my thoughts<br>
           Unspoken, only uttered to myself!</p>
             <p class="hang5">[She weeps silently with compressed lips, her<br>
               face turned toward the darkness.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  So many tears and in
such silence. This<br>
           Is not the shudder that relieves the anguish<br>
           Of youth. Here there is deeper pain to quiet<br>
           Than inborn rigidness of timid spirits.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   Lord, shouldst thou
waken in the night and find<br>
           Me weeping thus whenas I seem to sleep,<br>
           Then wake me, lest I do what thy good right<br>
           Forbids me. For in dreams upon thy bed<br>
           I shall be seeing then another man<br>
           And longing for him; this were not becoming,<br>
           And makes me shudder at myself to think it.<br>
           Oh promise me that thou wilt then awake me!</p>

           <p class="hang4">No question who it is? Does that not matter?<br>
           No? But thy face is gloomy and thou breathest<br>
           With effort? Then I will myself confess it:<br>
           Thou hast beheld him at our house ere now,<br>
           His name is Ganem&#8212;son of old Shalnassar,<br>
           			The carpet-dealer&#8212;and 'tis three years now<br>
           Since first I knew him. But since yesteryear<br>
           I have not seen him more.<br>
           This I have said, this last thing I reveal,<br>
           Because I will permit no sediment<br>
           Of secrecy and lies to lurk within me.<br>
           I care not thou shouldst know: I am no vessel<br>
           Sold off as pure, but lined with verdigris<br>
           To eat its bottom out&#8212;and then because<br>
           I wanted to be spared his frequent visits<br>
           In this abode&#8212;for that were hard to bear.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>  (threateningly, but soon
choked by wrath and pain).<br>
           Thou! Thou hast ... thou hast ...</p>
<p class="right">[He claps his hands to his face.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   Thou weepest too, then,
on thy wedding-day?<br>
           And have I spoiled some dream for thee? Look hither:<br>
           Thou sayst, I am so young, and this, and this&#8212;</p>
<p class="right">[Points to hair and cheeks.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">Are young indeed, but weary is my spirit,<br>
           So weary, that there is no word to tell<br>
           How weary and how aged before my time.<br>
           We are one age, perhaps thou art the younger.<br>
           In conversation once thou saidst to me,<br>
           That almost all the years since I was born<br>
           Had passed for thee in sitting in thy gardens<br>
           And in the quiet tower thou hast builded,<br>
           To watch the stars from it. 'Twas on that day<br>
           It first seemed possible to me, that thy<br>
           And, more than that, my father's fond desire<br>
           Might be ... fulfilled. For I supposed the air<br>
           In this thy house must have some lightness in it,<br>
           So light, so burdenless!&#8212;And in our house<br>
           It was so overladen with remembrance,<br>
           The airy corpse of sleepless nights went floating<br>
           All through it, and on all the walls there hung<br>
           The burden of those fondly cherished hopes,<br>
           Once vivid, then rejected, long since faded.<br>
           The glances of my parents rested ever<br>
           Upon me, and their whole existence.&#8212;Well,<br>
           Too well I knew each quiver of an eyelash,<br>
           And over all there was the constant pressure<br>
           Of thy commanding will, that on my soul<br>
           Lay like a coverlet of heavy sleep.<br>
           'Twas common, that I yielded at the last:<br>
           I seek no other word. And yet the common<br>
           Is strong, and all our life is full of it.<br>
           How could I thrust it down and trample on it,<br>
           While I was floundering in it up to the neck?</p>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  So my desire lay like a
cruel nightmare<br>
           Upon thy breast! Then thou must surely hate me ...</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   I hate thee not, I have
not learned to hate,<br>
           And only just began to learn to love.<br>
           The lessons stopped, but I am fairly able<br>
           To do such things as, with that smile thou knowest,<br>
           To dance, with heart as heavy as the stones,<br>
           To face each heavy day, each coming evil<br>
           With smiles: the utmost power of my youth<br>
           That smile consumed, but to the bitter end<br>
           I wore it, and so here I stand with thee.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  In this I see but
shadowy connection.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   How I connect my being
forced to smile<br>
           And finally becoming wife to thee?<br>
           Wilt thou know this? And must I tell thee all?<br>
           Then knowst thou, since thou art rich, so little<br>
           Of life, and hast no eyes for aught but stars,<br>
           And flowers in thy heated greenhouse? Listen:<br>
           This is the cause: a poor man is my father,<br>
           Not always poor, much worse: once rich, now poor,<br>
           And many people's debtor, most of all<br>
           Thy debtor. And his starving spirit lived<br>
           Upon my smile, as other people's hearts<br>
           On other lies. These last years, since thou camest,<br>
           I knew my task; till then had been my schooling.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  And so became my wife!<br>
           As quick she would have grasped her pointed shears<br>
           And opened up a vein and with her blood<br>
           Have let her life run out into a bath,<br>
           If that had been the price with which to purchase<br>
           Her father's freedom from his creditor!<br>
           ... Thus is a wish fulfilled!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   Be not distressed. This
is the way of life.<br>
           I am myself as in a waking dream.<br>
           As one who, taken sick, no more aright<br>
           Compares his thoughts, nor any more remembers<br>
           How on the day before he viewed a matter,<br>
           Nor what he then had feared or had expected:<br>
           He cannot look with eyes of yesterday ...<br>
           So also when we reach the worser stages<br>
           Of that great illness: Life. I scarcely know<br>
           Myself how great my fear of many things,<br>
           How much I longed for others, and I feel,<br>
           When some things cross my mind, as if it were<br>
           Another woman's fate, and not my own,<br>
           Just some one that I know about, not I.<br>
           I tell thee, I am bitter, but not evil:<br>
           And if at first I was too wild for thee,<br>
           There will be no deception in me later,<br>
           When I shall sit at ease and watch thy gardeners.<br>
           My head is tired out. I grow so dizzy,<br>
           When I must keep two things within myself<br>
           That fight against each other. Much too long<br>
           Have I been forced to do this. Give me peace!<br>
           Thou giv'st me this, and for that I am grateful.<br>
           Call not this little: terrible in weakness<br>
           Is everything that grows on shifting sands<br>
           Of doubt. But here is perfect certainty.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  And how of him?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>               That too
must not distress thee.<br>
           'Twere hard to judge, had I concealed it from thee;<br>
           I have revealed it now, so let it rest.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  Thou art not free of
him!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
So thinkest thou?<br>
           When is one &quot;free?&quot; Things have no hold on us,<br>
           Except we have in us the will to hold them.<br>
           All that is past. [Gesture.]

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span> (after a pause).<br>
           His love was like to thine?
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Sobeide</span>  nods.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">But then, why then, how has it come to pass<br>
           That he was not the one&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
Why, we were poor!<br>
           No, more than poor, thou knowst. His father, too.<br>
           Poor too. Besides, a gloomy man, as hard<br>
           As mine was all too soft, and on him weighing<br>
           As mine on me. The whole much easier<br>
           To live through than to put in words. For years<br>
           It lasted. We were children when it started,<br>
           Ere long as tired as foals, too early harnessed<br>
           For drawing heavy wagons in the harvest.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  But let me tell thee,
this cannot be true<br>
           About his father. I know old Shalnassar,<br>
           The carpet-dealer. Well, he is a graybeard,<br>
           And he who will may speak good of his name,<br>
           But I will not. A wicked, bad old man!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   May be, all one. To him
it is his father.<br>
           I ne'er have seen him. Ganem sees him so.<br>
           He calls him sick, is saddened when he speaks<br>
           Of him. And therefore I have never seen him,<br>
           That is, not since my childhood, when I saw<br>
           Him now and then upon the window leaning.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  But he's not poor, no,
anything but poor!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (sure of her facts, sadly
smiling).<br>
           Thinkst thou I should be here?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
And he?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   What, he?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  He clearly made thee
feel<br>
           He thought impossible, what he and thou<br>
           Had wished for years and long held possible?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   Why, for it was
impossible? ... and then<br>
           &quot;Had wished for years&quot;&#8212;thou seest, all these matters<br>
           Are different, and the words we use<br>
           Are different. At one time this has ripened,<br>
           But to decay again. For there are moments<br>
           With cheeks that burn like the eternal suns&#8212;<br>
           When somewhere hovers mute an unconfessed<br>
           Confession, somewhere vanishes in air<br>
           The echo of a call that never reached<br>
           Its utterance; here in me something whispers,<br>
           &quot;I yielded to him;&quot; mark: in thought! &quot;I yielded&quot;&#8212;<br>
           The following moment swallows everything,<br>
           As night the lightning flash ... How all began<br>
           And ended? Well, in this wise: first I sealed<br>
           My lips, soon then set seal upon my eye-lids,<br>
           And he&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>          Well, how was
he?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
Why, very noble.<br>
           As one who seeks to sully his own image<br>
           In other eyes, to spare that other pain&#8212;<br>
           Quite different, no longer kind as once<br>
           &#8212;It was the greatest kindness, so to act&#8212;<br>
           His spirit rent and full of mockery, that<br>
           Perhaps was bitterer to himself than me,<br>
           Just like an actor oftentimes, so strangely<br>
           With set intent. At other times again<br>
           Discoursing of the future, of the time<br>
           When I should give my hand&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span> (vehemently).<br>
           To me?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (coldly).<br>
           When I should give my hand to any other;&#8212;<br>
           Describing what he knew that I should never<br>
           Endure, if life should ever take that form.<br>
           As little as himself would e'er have borne it<br>
           A single hour, for he but made a show,<br>
           Acquaint with me, and knowing it would cost<br>
           The less of pain to wrench my heart from him,<br>
           So soon as I had come to doubt his faith.</p>

                          <p class="center">(At the window.)</p>
           <p class="hang4">That evening must not come, that should discover<br>
           Me sitting at this window without thee:<br>
           &#8212;Just not to be at home, not from the window<br>
           Of my long girlhood's chamber to look out<br>
           Into the darkness, has a dangerous,<br>
           Peculiar and confusing power, as if<br>
           I lay upon the open road, no man's possession,<br>
           As fully mine as never in my dreams!<br>
           A maiden's life is much more strictly ruled<br>
           By pressure of the air, than thou conceivest,<br>
           To whom it seems most natural to be free.<br>
           The evening ne'er must come, when I should thus<br>
           Stand here, with all the weight of heavy shadows,<br>
           My parents' eyes, all, all behind me thrust,<br>
           Involved in yon dark hangings at my back,<br>
           And this brave landscape with the golden stars,<br>
           The gentle breeze, the bushes, thus before me.</p>
                     <p class="center">(With growing agitation.)</p>
           <p class="hang4">The evening ne'er must come, when I should see<br>
           All this with eyes like these, to say to me:<br>
           Here lies a road that shimmers in the moonlight:<br>
           Before the gentle breeze the next light cloudlet<br>
           Impels to meet the moon, a man could run<br>
           That road unto its end, between the hedges,<br>
           Then comes a cross-road, now a planted field,<br>
           And then the shadow of the standing corn,<br>
           At last a garden! There his hand would touch<br>
           At once a curtain, back of which is all:<br>
           All kissing, laughing, all the happiness<br>
           This world can give promiscuously flung<br>
           About like balls of golden wool, such bliss<br>
           That but a drop of it on parchéd lips<br>
           Suffices to be lighter than a flame,<br>
           To see no more of difficulty, nor<br>
           To understand what men call ugliness!</p>
                       <p class="center">(Almost shrieking.)</p>
           <p class="hang4">The evening ne'er must come, that with a thousand<br>
           Unfettered tongues should cry to me: why not?<br>
           Why hast thou never run in dark of night<br>
           That road? Thy feet were young, thy breath sufficient:<br>
           Why hast thou saved it, that thou mightst have plenty<br>
           To weep a thousand nights upon thy pillow?</p>
             <p class="hang5">[She turns her back to the window, clutches<br>

               table, her body shaken with weeping. A<br>
               long pause.]</p>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  And if the first door I
should open wide,<br>
           The only locked one on this road of love?</p>
             <p class="hang5">[He opens the small doorway leading into<br>
               the garden on the right; the moonlight<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (still kneeling by the table).<br>
           Art thou so cruel as, in this first hour,<br>
                To make a silly pastime of my weeping!<br>
                Art thou so fain to put thy scorn upon me?<br>
                Art thou so proud of holding me securely?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>  (with the utmost
self-control).<br>
           How much I could have wished that thou hadst learned<br>
           To know me otherwise, but now there is<br>
           No time for that.<br>
           Thy father, if 'tis this which so constrains thee,<br>
           Thy father owes me nothing now, indeed<br>
           Within some days agreements have been made<br>
           Between us twain, from which some little profit<br>
           And so, I hope, a much belated gleam<br>
           Of joyousness may come.</p>
             <p class="hang5">[She has crept closer to him on her knees,<br>
               listening.]</p>
                                 <p class="hang4">So then thou mightest&#8212;<br>
           						Thou mayst, I mean to say, if it was this<br>
           						That lamed thee most, if in this&#8212;<i>alien</i>
									dwelling<br>
           						Again thou feel the will to live, which thou<br>
           						Hadst lost, if, as from heavy sleep aroused,<br>
           						Yet not awake, thou feel it is this portal<br>
           						That leads thee out to pulsing, waking life&#8212;<br>
           						Then in the name of God and of the stars<br>
           						I give thee leave to go where'er thou wilt.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (still on her knees).<br>
           What?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  I do no more regard thee
as my wife<br>
           Than any other maid who, for protection<br>
           From tempest or from robbers by the wayside,<br>
           Had entered for a space into my house,<br>
           And I renounce herewith my claim upon thee,<br>
           Just as I have no valid right to any,<br>
           Whom such a chance might cast beneath my roof.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   What sayest thou?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>                        I
say that thou art free<br>
           To pass out through this door, and where thou wilt.<br>
           Free as the wind, the butterfly, the water.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (half standing).<br>
           To go?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>            To go.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
Where'er I will?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
Where 'er<br>
           Thou wilt, and at what time thou wilt.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (still half dazed, now at the
door).<br>
                                              Now? Here?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>  Or now, or later.<br>
           Here, or otherwhere.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (doubtfully).<br>
           But to my parents only?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span> (in a more decided tone).<br>
                        Where thou wilt.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (laughing and Weeping at once).<br>
           This dost thou then? O never in a dream<br>
           I ventured such a thought, in maddest dreams<br>
           I ne'er had crept to thee upon my knees</p>
<p class="right">[She falls on her knees before him.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">With this request, lest I should see thy laughter<br>
           Upon such madness ... yet thou doest it,<br>
           Thou doest it! O thou! Thou good, good man!</p>
             <p class="hang5">[He raises her gently, she stands bewildered.]</p>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>  (turns away).<br>
           When wilt thou go?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
This very instant, now!<br>
           O be not angry, think not ill of me!<br>
           Consider: can I tarry in thy house,<br>
           A stranger's house this night? Must I not go<br>
           At once to him, since I belong to him?<br>
           How may his property this night inhabit<br>
           An alien house, as it were masterless?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>  (bitterly).<br>
           Already his?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>                    Why
sir, a proper woman<br>
           Is never masterless: for from her father<br>
           Her husband takes her, she belongs to him,<br>
           Be he alive or resting in the earth.<br>
           Her next and latest master&#8212;that is Death.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  Then wilt thou not, at
least till break of day,<br>
           Return to rest at home?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
No, no, my friend.<br>
           All that is past. My road, once and for all,<br>
           Is not the common one, this hour divides<br>
           Me altogether from all maiden ways.<br>
           So let me walk it to its very end<br>
           In this one night, that in a later day<br>
           All this be like a dream, nor I have need<br>
           To feel ashamed.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>                   Then
go!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
I give thee pain?</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Merchant</span> turns away.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">Permit a single draught from yonder goblet.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  It was my mother's, take
it to thyself.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   I cannot. Lord. But let
me drink from it.
<p class="right">[Drinks.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  Drain this, and never
mayst thou need in life<br>
           To quench thy thirst with wine from any goblet<br>
           Less pure than that.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
Farewell.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
Farewell.</p>
<p class="right">[She is already on the threshold.]</p>
<p class="hang4">Hast thou no fear? Thou never yet hast walked<br>
           Alone. We dwell without the city wall.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   Dear friend, I feel
above all weakling fear,<br>
           And light my foot, as never in the daytime.</p>
<p class="right">[Exit.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>  (after following her long
with his eyes, with a<br>
             gesture of pain).<br>
           As if some plant were drawing quiet rootlets<br>
           From out my heart, to take wing after her,<br>
           And air were entering all the empty sockets!</p>
<p class="right">[He steps away from the window.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">Does she not really seem to me less fair,<br>
           So hasty, so desirous to run thither,<br>
           Where scarce she knows if any wait her coming!<br>
           No: 'tis her youth that I must see aright;<br>
           This is a part of all things beautiful,<br>
           And all this haste becomes this creature just<br>
           As mute aspects become the fairest flowers.</p>

<p class="right">[Pause.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">I think what I have done is of a part<br>
           With my conception of the world's great movement.<br>
           I will not have one set of lofty thoughts<br>
           When I behold high up the circling stars,<br>
           And others when a young girl stands before me.<br>
           What <i>there</i> is truth, must be so here as well,<br>
           And I must say, if yonder wedded child<br>
           Cannot endure to harbor in her spirit<br>
           Two things, of which the one belies the other,<br>
           Am I prepared to make my acts deny<br>
           What I have learned through groping premonition<br>
           And reason from that monstrous principle<br>
           That towers upon the earth and strikes the stars?<br>
           I call it Life, that monstrous thing, this too<br>
           Is life&#8212;and who might venture to divide them?<br>
           And what is ripeness, if not recognizing<br>
           That men and stars have but one law to guide them?<br>
           And so herein I see the hand of fate,<br>
           That bids me live as lonely as before,<br>
           And heirless&#8212;when I speak the last good-by&#8212;<br>
           And with no loving hand in mine, to die.</p>

<h2>SCENE II</h2>


<p class="hang1">A wainscoted room in <span class="sc">Shalnassar's</span>
house. An ascending stairway, narrow and steep, in the right background; a
descending one at the left. A gallery of open woodwork with openings, inner
balconies, runs about the entire stage. Unshaded hanging lamps. Curtained
doorways to the left and right. Against the left wall a low bench, farther to
the rear a table and seats.</p>
<p class="hang1">Old <span class="sc">Shalnassar</span> sits on the bench near
the left doorway, wrapped in a cloak. Before him stands a young man, the
impoverished merchant.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shalnass</span>. <br>  Were I as rich as you
regard me&#8212;truly<br>
           I am not so, quite far from that, my friend&#8212;<br>
           I could not even then grant this postponement,<br>
           Nay, really, friend, and solely for your sake:<br>
           For too indulgent creditors, by Heaven,<br>
           Are debtors' ruin.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Debtor</span>. <br>
           Hear me now, Shalnassar!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shalnass</span>. <br>  No more. I can hear
nothing. Yea, my deafness<br>
           But grows apace with all your talking. Go!<br>
           Go home, I say: think how you may retrench.<br>
           I know your house, 'tis overrun with vermin,<br>
           I mean the servants. Curtail the expenses<br>
           Your wife has caused: they are most unbecoming<br>
           For your position. What? I am not here<br>
           To give you counsel. Home with you, I tell you.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Debtor</span>. <br>
           I wanted to, my heart detains me here,<br>
           This heart that swells with pain. Go home? To me<br>
           The very door of my own house is hateful.<br>
           I cannot enter, but some creditor<br>
           Would block my way.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shalnass</span>. <br>                   Well,
what a fool you were.<br>
           Go home and join your lovely wife, be off!<br>
           Go home! Bring offspring into life. Then starve!</p>
             <p class="hang5">[He claps his hands. The Armenian slave<br>
               comes up the stairs. <span class="sc">Shalnassar</span> whispers<br>
               with him, without heeding the other.]</p>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Debtor</span>. <br>
           Not fifty florins have I in the world.<br>
           You spoke of servants? Aye, one withered crone<br>
           To carry water, that is all. And she<br>
           How long? No wretch abandoned, fed with alms,<br>
           Feels misery like mine: for I have known<br>
           The sweets of wealth. Through every night I slept,<br>
           Contentment round my head, and sweet was morning.<br>
           But hush! she loves me still, and so my failure<br>
           Is bright and golden. O, she is my wife!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shalnass</span>. <br>  I beg you, go, the lamps
will have to burn<br>
           So long as you are standing round. Go with him.<br>
           Here are the keys.</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Debtor</span> (overcoming his fear).<br>
           A word, good Shalnassar!<br>
           I had not wished to beg you for reprieve.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shalnass</span>. <br>  What? Does my deafness
cause me some illusion?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Debtor</span>. <br>
           No, really.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shalnass</span>. <br>              But?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Debtor</span>. <br>
           But for another loan.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shalnass</span> (furious).<br>
           What do You want?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Debtor</span>. <br>
           Not what I want, but must.<br>
           Thou never hast beheld her, thou must see her!<br>
           My heavy heart gives o'er its sullen beating<br>
           And leaps with joy, whene'er I look upon her.<br>
                    (With growing agitation.)<br>
           All this must yet be altered. Her fair limbs<br>
           Are for the cult of tenderness created,<br>
           Not for the savage claws of desperation.<br>
           She cannot go a-begging, with such hair.<br>
           Her mouth is proud as it is sweet. O, fate<br>
           Is trying to outwit me&#8212;but I scorn it&#8212;<br>
           If thou couldst see her, old man&#8212;<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">
Shalnass</span>. <br>                                  I <i>will</i> see her!<br>
           Tell her the man of years, upon whose gold<br>
           Her husband young so much depends&#8212;now mark:<br>
           The good old man, say, the decrepit gray-beard&#8212;<br>
           Desired to see her. Tell her men of years<br>
           Are childish, why should this one not be so?<br>
           But still a call is little. Tell her this:<br>
           It is almost a grave that she would visit,<br>
           A grave just barely breathing. Will you do't?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Debtor</span>. <br>
           I've heard it said that you adore your gold<br>
           Like something sacred, and that next to that<br>
           You love the countenance of anguished men,<br>
           And looks that mirror forth the spirit's pain.<br>
           But you are old, have sons, and so I think<br>
           These evil sayings false. And therefore I<br>
           Will tell her this, and if perchance she asks me,<br>
           &quot;What thinkest thou?&quot; then I will say, &quot;My dearest,<br>
           Peculiar, but not bad.&quot;&#8212;Farewell, but pray you,<br>
           When your desire is granted, let not mine,<br>
           Shalnassar, wait long for its due fulfilment.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shalnass</span>. (alone, rises, stretches,
seems much taller now).<br>
           A honeyed fool is that, a sweet-voiced babbler,<br>
           &quot;Hear, aged man!&quot;&#8212;&quot;I beg you, aged man!&quot;<br>
           I've heard men say his wife is beautiful,<br>
           And has such fiery color in her hair<br>
           That fingers tumbling it feel heat and billows<br>
           At once. If she comes not, then she shall learn<br>
           To sleep on naked straw....<br>
<span style="letter-spacing:40px">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
... 'Twere time to sleep.<br>
           They say that convalescents need much sleep.<br>
           But if I must be deaf, then I'll be deaf<br>
           To wisdom such as this. Sleep is naught other<br>

           He now is but the shadow of himself,<br>
           And though he still stands threatening there, his feet<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganem</span>. <br>                The limping
daughter of a poor<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Gülistane</span>. <br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganem</span>. <br>     What's in a name? Her
eyes, with doglike fear,<br>

           That lure me, since so greedily they drink<br>
           In lies, and weave out of themselves such fancies.<br>
           And so I oft would stand and talk to her.</p>

<h2>SCENE III</h2>


<p class="hang1">The garden of the rich merchant. The high wall runs from the
right foreground backward toward the left. Steps lead to a small latticed gate
in the wall. To the left a winding path is lost among the trees. It is early
morning. The shrubs are laden with blossoms, and the meadows are full of
flowers. In the foreground the gardener and his wife are engaged in taking
delicate blooming shrubs from an open barrow and setting them in prepared holes.</p>
<br>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Gardener</span>. <br> The rest are coming now.
But no, that is<br>
           A single man ... The master!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Wife</span>. <br>
What? He's up<br>
           Ere dawn, and yesterday his wedding-day?<br>
           Alone he walks the garden&#8212;that's no man<br>
           Like other men.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Gardener</span>. <br>                 Be still,
he's coming hither.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span> (walks up slowly from the
left).<br>
           The hour of morn, before the sun is up,<br>
           When all the branches in the lifeless light<br>
           Hang dead and dull, is terrible. I feel<br>
           As if I saw the whole world in a frightful<br>
           And vacant glass, as dreary as my mind's eye.<br>
           O would all flowers might wither! Would my garden<br>
           Were poisonous morass, filled to the full<br>
           With rotted corpses of these blooming trees,<br>
           And my corpse in their midst.</p>
             <p class="hang5">[He is pulling to pieces a blossoming twig,<br>
               stops short and drops it.]</p>
                                          <p class="hang4">Ah, what a fool!<br>
           								A gray-haired fool, as old as
											melancholy,<br>
           								Ridiculous as old! I'll sit me down<br>
           								And bind up wreaths and weep into the
											water.</p>
             <p class="hang5">[He walks on a few paces, lifts his hand as<br>
               if involuntarily to his heart.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">O how like glass this is, and how the finger<br>
           With which fate raps upon it, like to iron!<br>
           Years form no rings on men as on the trees,<br>
           Nor fashion breast-plates to protect the heart.</p>

             <p class="hang5">[Again he walks a few paces, and so comes<br>
               upon the gardener, who takes off his straw<br>
               hat; he starts up out of his revery, and<br>
               looks inquiringly at the gardener.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Gardener</span> (bowing low).<br>

           'Tis so, my lord. But she returned to me,<br>
           And lives with me thenceforth.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>                            And
lives with thee?<br>
           The fellow beat her, doubtless! Thou dost not.</p>
<p class="right">[He turns away, his tone becomes bitter.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">Why, let us seat ourselves here in the grass,<br>

           He lives with her thenceforth. Why yes, he has her!<br>
           Possession is the end of all! And folly<br>
           It were to scorn the common, when our life<br>

           The big one, with the willows on its banks?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Gardener</span> (pointing to the right).<br>
           Down there it lies, my mistress, thou canst see it.<br>
           But shall I guide thee?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (with a vehement gesture).<br>
No, no, leave me, go!</p>
             <p class="hang5">[She is about to go off toward the right; the<br>
               old slave catches her dress and holds her<br>
               back. She turns. <span class="sc">Old Slave</span> holds out his<br>
               hand like a beggar, but withdraws it at<br>
               once in embarrassment.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   What?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Old Slave</span>. <br>
           Thou art at home, I'm going back again.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   Oh yes, and I have
robbed thee of thy sleep,<br>
           And give thee naught for it. And thou art old<br>
           And poor. But I have nothing, less than nothing!<br>
           As poor as I no beggar ever was.</p>
           <p class="hang5">[<span class="sc">Old Slave</span> screws up his

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (looks helplessly about her,
puts her hand to her<br>
             hair, feels her pearl pendants, takes them off,<br>
             and gives them to him).<br>
           Take this, and this, and go!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Old Slave</span> (shakes his head).<br>
           Oh no, not that!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span> (in a torment of haste).<br>

<p class="right">[Starts away.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Old Slave</span> (holds them in his hand).<br>
           No, take them back. Give me some little coin.<br>
           I'm but a poor old fool. And they would come,<br>
           Shalnassar and the others, down upon me,<br>
           And take the pearls away. For I am old<br>
           And such a beggar. This would be my ruin.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   I have naught else. But
come again tonight<br>
           And bring them to the master here, my husband.<br>
           He'll give thee money for them.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Old Slave</span>. <br>
Thou'lt be here?<br>

           If he is kind, oh do thou pray for me,<br>

           Is rich and has so many. I am eager,<br>
           Need little sleep. But in Shalnassar's house<br>
           I always have such hunger in the evening.<br>
           I will&#8212;</p>

           I loved her so! Ah, how this life of ours<br>
           Resembles dreams illusory. Today<br>
           I might have had her, here and always, I!<br>
           Possession is the whole: slow-growing power<br>

           Interstices, feeds thus the wondrous lamp<br>
           Within the spirit, and soon from such eyes<br>
           There bursts a mightier, sweeter gleam than moonlight.<br>
           Oh, I have loved her so! I fain would see her,<br>
           See her once more. My eye sees naught but death:<br>
           The flowers wilt before my eyes like candles,<br>
           When they begin to run: all, all is dying,<br>

           The woman on the tower, bending forward,<br>
           Why does she so bend forward? Look, look<br>

           Forbear, I'm dying; hush, I know it well.<br>
           Dear husband, hush, I beg thee. Thee I had<br>
           Not thought to see again&#8212;<br>
           I need to crave thy pardon.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span> (tenderly).<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>
Not this.<br>
           This had to be.&#8212;No, what took place last night:<br>
           I did to thee what should become no woman,<br>
           And all my destiny I grasped and treated<br>
           As I in dancing used to treat my veils.<br>
           With fingers vain I tampered with my Self.<br>
           Speak not, but understand.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
           What happened&#8212;then?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   Ask not what happened;
ask me not, I beg thee.<br>
           I had before been weary: 'twas the same<br>
           Up to the end. But now 'tis easy. Thou<br>
           Art good, I'll tell thee something else: my parents&#8212;<br>
           Thou knowest how they are&#8212;I bid thee take them<br>
           To live with thee.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
           Yes, yes, but thou wilt live.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   No, say not so; but
mark, I fain would tell thee<br>
           A many things. Oh yes, that graybeard man.<br>
           He's very poor, take him into thy house<br>
           At my request.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>
           Now thou shalt bide with me.<br>
           I will thy every wish divine: breathe softly<br>
           As e'er thou wilt, yet I will be the lyre<br>
           To answer every breath with harmony,<br>
           Until thou weary and bid it be still.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>   Say not such words, for
I am dizzy and<br>
           They flicker in my eyes. Lament not much,<br>
           I beg of thee. If I remained alive,<br>
           All mangled as I am, I never could<br>
           Bring children into life for thee; my body<br>
           Would be so ugly, whereas formerly<br>
           I know I had some beauty. This would be<br>
           So hard for thee to bear and hide from me.<br>
           But I shall die at once, I know, my dear.<br>
           This is so strange: our spirits dwell in us<br>
           Like captive birds. And when the cage is shattered,<br>

           It flies away. No, no, thou must not smile:<br>
           I feel it is so. Look, the flowers know it,<br>
           And shine the brighter since I know it too.<br>
           Canst thou not understand? Mark well my words. [Pause.]<br>
           Art thou still there, and I too, all this while?<br>
           Oh, now I see thy face, and it is other<br>
           Than e'er I saw till now. Art thou my husband?</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span>. <br>  My child!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Sobeide</span>. <br>              Thy spirit
seems to bend and lean<br>
           Out of thine eyes, and oh, the words thou speakest!<br>
           They quiver in the air, because the heart<br>
           So quivers, whence they come. Weep not, I can<br>
           Not bear it, for I love thee so. O let<br>
           Me see as last of all thine eyes. We should<br>
           Have lived together long and had our children.<br>
           But now 'tis fearful&#8212;for my parents.</p>
<p class="right">[Dies.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Merchant</span> (half bowed).<br>
           Thus noiseless falls a star. Meseems, her heart<br>
           Was never close united with the world.<br>
           And what have I of her, except this glance,<br>
           Whose closing was involved in rigid Lethe,<br>
           And in such words as by false breath of life<br>
           Were made to sound so strong, e'en while they faded,<br>
           Just as the wind, ere he lies down to sleep,<br>
           Deceitful swells the sails as ne'er before.</p>
<p class="right">[He rises.]</p>
<p style="margin-left:7em;">Aye, lift her up. So bitter is this life:<br>

           Was oped&#8212;and back she came in such distress,<br>
           Death-stricken, that but issued forth the evening prior&#8212;<br>
           As fishers, cheeks with sun and moon afire,<br>
           Prepare their nets&#8212;in hopes of great success.</p>

<h2>THE GREEN COCKATOO (1899)</h2>

<h3>TRANSLATED BY HORACE SAMUEL</h3>



<h3>SCENE.&#8212;THE TAVERN OF THE GREEN COCKATOO</h3>


<p class="normal">A medium-sized underground room. Seven steps lead down to it
on the Right (rather far back). The stairs are shut off by a door on top. A
second door which is barely visible is in the background on the Left. A number
of simple wooden tables with chairs around them fill nearly the whole room. On
the Left in the Centre is a bar; behind the bar a number of barrels with pipes.
The room is lighted by small oil lamps which hang from the ceiling.</p>

<p class="center">The <span class="sc">Host</span>, <span class="sc">Prosper</span>.
Enter the citizens <span class="sc">Lebrêt</span> and <span class="sc">Grasset</span>. </p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span> (coming down the steps). Come
in, Lebrêt. I know the tap. My old friend and chief has always got a cask of
wine smuggled away somewhere or other, even when all the rest of Paris is
perishing of thirst.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Good evening, Grasset. So you
show your face again, do you? Away with Philosophy! Have you a wish to take an
engagement with me again?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. The idea! Bring some wine
rather. I am the guest&#8212;you the host.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Wine? Where shall I get wine
from, Grasset? They've sacked all the wine-shops in Paris this very night. And I
would lieve wager that you had a hand therein.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Out with the wine. The mob who
are coming an hour after us are bound&#8212; (Listening.) Do you hear anything,
Labrêt?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. It is like slight thunder.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Good!&#8212;Citizens of Paris&#8212; (To <span class="sc">
Host</span>. ) You're sure to have another barrel in reserve for the mob&#8212;so out
with our wine; my friend and admirer, the Citizen Labrêt, tailor of the Rue St.
Honoré, will pay for everything.</p>

pay.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Show him that you have money,

											draws out his purse.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Now I will see if I&#8212; (He opens
the cock of a barrel and fills two glasses.) Where do yon come from, Grasset?
The Palais-Royal?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. For sure&#8212;I made a speech
there. Ay, my good friend, it is my turn now. Do you know whom I spoke after?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Well?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. After Camille Desmoulins. Yes,
indeed, I dared to do it. And tell me, Labrêt, who had the greater
applause&#8212;Desmoulins or I?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. You&#8212;without a doubt.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. And how did I bear myself?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. Splendidly.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Do you hear, Prosper? I placed
myself on the table&#8212;I looked like a monument&#8212;indeed I did&#8212;and all the
thousands&#8212;five thousands, ten thousands, assembled round me&#8212;just as they had
done before round Camille Desmoulins&#8212;and cheered me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. It was a louder cheer,</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Indeed it was ... not much
louder, but it was louder. And now they're all moving toward the Bastille ...
and I make bold to say they have followed my call. I swear to you before the
evening is out we shall have it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Yes, to be sure, if the walls
fall down before your speeches!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. What&#8212;speeches&#8212;are you deaf?
'Tis a case of shooting now. Our valiant soldiers are there. They have the same
hellish fury against the accursed prison as we have. They know that their
brothers and fathers sit imprisoned behind those walls.... But there would have
been no shooting if we had not spoken. My dear Prosper, great is the power of
intellect. There&#8212;(to <span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>) where are the papers?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. Here! (Pulls pamphlets out of
his pocket.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Here are the latest pamphlets
which have just been distributed in the Palais-Royal. Here is one by my friend
Cerutti&#8212;&quot;Memorial for the French People;&quot; here is one by Desmoulins, who
certainly speaks better than he writes&#8212;&quot;Free France.&quot;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. When's your own pamphlet going to
appear&#8212;the one you're always talking about, you know?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. We need no more. The time has
come for deeds. Anyone who sits within his four walls today is a knave. Every
real man must go out into the streets.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. Bravo!&#8212;Bravo!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. In Toulon they have killed the
mayor; in Brignolles they have sacked a dozen houses; but we in Paris are always
sluggards and will put up with anything.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. You can scarcely say that now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. (who has been drinking
steadily). Up, you citizens, up!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Up! Lock up your shop and come
with us now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. I'll come right enough, when the
time comes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Ay, to be sure, when there is
no more danger.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. My good friend, I love Liberty as
well as you do, but my calling comes before everything.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. There is only one calling now
for citizens of Paris&#8212;freeing their brothers.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Yes, for those who have nothing
else to do!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. What says he? He makes game of
us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Never dreamt of it. But now, my
friends, look to it that you go away&#8212;my performance will begin in a minute, and
I can't find you a job in it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. What performance? Is this a
theatre?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Certainly, 'tis a theatre. Why,
only a fortnight ago your friend was playing here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. Were you playing here,
Grasset?... Why do you let the fellow jeer at you like that without punishing
him?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Calm yourself&#8212;it is true; I
did play here. This is no ordinary tavern: 'tis a den of thieves. Come.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. You'll pay first.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. If this is a den of thieves I
won't pay a single sou.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Explain to your friend where he
is.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. This is a strange place.
People who play criminals come here&#8212;and others who are criminals without
suspecting it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. Indeed?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. I would have you mark that
what I just said was very witty; it is positively capable of making the
substance of a whole speech.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. I don't understand a word of
all you say.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. I was simply telling you that
Prosper was my manager. And he is still playing comedy with his actors, but a
different kind from before. My former gentlemen and lady colleagues sit around
and behave as though they were criminals. Do you understand! They tell
blood-curdling stories of things that have never happened to them&#8212;speak of
crimes they have never committed ... and the audience that comes here enjoys the
pleasant titillation of hobnobbing with the most dangerous rabble in
Paris&#8212;swindlers, burglars, murderers&#8212;and&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. What kind of an audience?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. The most elegant people in Paris.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Noble&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Gentlemen of the Court.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. Down with them!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. It does 'em good. It gives a
fillip to their jaded senses. 'Twas here that I made my start, Labrêt&#8212;here that
I delivered my first speech as though for a joke; here it was that I first began
to hate the dogs who sat amongst us with all their fine clothes and perfumes and
rottenness ... and I am very glad indeed, my good Labrêt, that you, too, should
see just for once the place from which your great friend raised himself. (In
another tone.) I say, Prosper, supposing the business doesn't come off&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What business?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Why, my political career&#8212;will
you engage me again?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Not for anything!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span> (lightly). Why&#8212;I thought there
might be still room for somebody besides your Henri.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Apart from that ... I should be
afraid that you might forget yourself one fine day and fall foul in earnest of
one of my paying customers.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span> (flattered). That would
certainly be possible&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. I&#8212;I have control over myself&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Frankly, Prosper, I must say
that I would admire you for your self-control, if I happened not to know that
you are a poltroon.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Ah! my friend, I am satisfied
with what I can do in my own line. I get enough pleasure out of being able to
tell the fellows my opinion of them to their faces and to insult them to my
heart's content&#8212;while they take it for a joke. That, too, is a way of venting
one's wrath. (Draws a dagger and makes it flash.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. Citizen Prosper, what is the
meaning of this?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Have no fear. I wager that the
dagger is not even sharpened.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. In that, my friend, you may be
making a mistake. One fine day the jest may turn to earnest&#8212;and so I am ready
for all emergencies.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. The day is nigh. We live in
great times. Come, Citizen Labrêt, we will go to our comrades. Farewell,
Prosper; you will see me either a great man or never again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span> (giddily). As a great man&#8212;or&#8212;not
at all.</p>
<p class="hang2">[Exeunt. <span class="sc">Host</span> remains behind, sits on a
table, opens a pamphlet, and reads aloud.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. &quot;Now that the beast is in the
noose, throttle it.&quot; He doesn't write badly, that little Desmoulins. &quot;Never was
richer booty offered to the victors. Forty thousand palaces and castles,
two-fifths of all the property in France, will be the reward of valor. Those who
plume themselves on being conquerors will be put beneath the yoke, the nation
will be purged.&quot;</p>
<p class="center">Enter the <span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. </p>
<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (sizing him up). Hallo&#8212;the
rabble's beginning to come in pretty early tonight.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. My dear Prosper, don't
start any of your jokes on me; I am the Commissaire of your district.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. And how can I be of any service?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. I have orders to attend
the performance in your tavern this evening.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. It will be an especial honor for
me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. 'Tis nothing of that, my
excellent Prosper. The authorities wish to have definite information as to what
really goes on in your place. For some weeks&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. This is a place of amusement, M.
le Commissaire&#8212;nothing more.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. Let me finish what I was
saying. For some weeks past this place is said to have been the theatre of wild
orgies.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. You are falsely informed, M. le
Commissaire. We make jokes here, nothing more.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. It begins with that, I
know. But it finishes up in another way, so I am informed. You have been an
actor.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. A manager, sir&#8212;manager of a
first-class troupe who last played in Denis.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. That is immaterial. Then
you came into a small legacy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Not worth speaking about, M. le
Commissaire.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. Your troupe split up.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. And my legacy as well.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span> (smiling). Very well! (Both
smile. Suddenly serious.) You started a tavern.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. That fared wretchedly.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. After which you had an
idea that, which, as one must admit, possesses a certain quantum of originality.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. You make me quite proud, sir.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. You gathered your troupe
together again, and have a comedy played here which is of a peculiar and by no
means harmless character.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. If it were harmful, M. le
Commissaire, I should not have my audience&#8212;the most aristocratic audience in
Paris, I'm in a position to say. The Vicomte de Nogeant is my daily customer.
The Marquis de Lansac often comes, and the Duc de Cadignan, M. le Commissaire,
is the most enthusiastic admirer of my leading actor, the celebrated Henri
Baston.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. As well as of the art or
arts of your actresses.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. When you get to know my little
actresses, M. le Commissaire, you won't blame anybody in the whole world for
that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. Enough. The authorities
have been informed that the entertainments which your&#8212;what shall I say&#8212;?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. The word &quot;artists&quot; ought to
suffice.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. I will decide on the word
&quot;subjects&quot;&#8212;that the entertainments which your subjects provide transgress in
every sense the limits the laws allow. Speeches are said to be delivered by
your&#8212;what shall I say?&#8212;by your artist-criminals which&#8212;what does my information
say?&#8212;(he reads from a notebook, as he had been doing previously) which are
calculated to produce not only an immoral effect, which would bother us but
little, but a highly seditious effect&#8212;a matter to which the authorities
absolutely cannot be indifferent, at a time so agitated as the one in which we
live.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. M. le Commissaire, I can only
answer that accusation by politely inviting you to see the thing just once for
yourself. You will observe that nothing of a seditious nature takes place here,
if only because my audience will not permit itself to be made seditious. There
is simply a theatrical performance here, that is all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. I naturally cannot accept
your invitation, but I will stay here by virtue of my office.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. I think I can promise you a
first-class entertainment, M. le Commissaire; but I will take the liberty of
advising you to doff your official garb and to appear here in civilian clothes.
If people actually saw a Commissaire in uniform here, both the spontaneity of my
artists and the mood of my audience would suffer thereby.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. You are right, M. Prosper;
I will go away and come back as an elegant young man.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. You will have no difficulty about
that, M. le Commissaire. You would be welcomed here even as a vagabond&#8212;that
would not excite attention&#8212;but not as a Commissaire.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. Good-by. (Starts to go.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (bowing). When will the blessed
day come when I can treat you and your damned likes&#8212;?</p>
<p class="hang2">[The <span class="sc">Commissaire</span> meets <span class="sc">
Grain</span> in the doorway.
       <span class="sc">Grain</span> is in absolute rags and gives a start when
he sees the <span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. The latter looks at him first,
smiles, and then turns courteously to <span class="sc">Host</span>. ]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. One of your artists
already? [Exit.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span> (whining pathetically). Good
evening.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (after looking at him for a long
time). If you're one of my troupe, I won't grudge you my recognition ... of your
art, because I don't recognize you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. No jests now; take off your wig;
I'd rather like to know who you are. (He pulls at his hair.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Oh, dear!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. But 'tis genuine! Heavens&#8212;who are
you? You appear to be a real ragamuffin.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. I am!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What do you want of me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Have I the honor of speaking to
Citizen Prosper?&#8212;the host of The Green Cockatoo?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. I am he.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. My name is Grain, sometimes
Carniche&#8212;very often Shrieking Pumice-stone; but I was sent to prison, Citizen
Prosper, under the name of Grain, and that is the real point.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Ah, I understand. You want to
play in my establishment and start off with playing me. Good. Go on.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Citizen Prosper, don't look upon
me as a swindler. I am a man of honor. If I tell you that I was imprisoned, 'tis
the complete truth.</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Host</span> looks at him suspiciously.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span> (pulling a paper out of his pocket). Here, Citizen
Prosper, you can see from this that I was let out yesterday afternoon at four
o'clock.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. After two years' imprisonment!
Zounds, 'tis genuine!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Were you all the time doubting
it, then. Citizen Prosper?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>.
 What did you do to get two years?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. I would have been hanged; but I
was lucky enough to be still half a child when I killed my poor aunt.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Nay, fellow, how can a man kill
his own aunt?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Citizen Prosper, I would never
have done it if my aunt had not deceived me with my best friend.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Your aunt?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. That's it&#8212;she was dearer to me
than aunts usually are to their nephews. The family relations were peculiar&#8212;it
made me embittered, most embittered. May I tell you about it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Go on telling&#8212;perhaps you and I
will be able to do business together.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. My sister was but half a child
when she ran away from home&#8212;and whom do you think she went with?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. 'Tis difficult to guess.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. With her uncle. And he left her
in the lurch&#8212;with a child&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. A whole one, I hope.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. 'Tis indelicate of you, Citizen
Prosper, to jest about such things.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. I'll tell you what, Shrieking
Pumice-stone, you&#8212;your family history bores me. Do you think I'm here to listen
to every Tom, Dick, or Harry o' a ragamuffin telling me whom he has killed?
What's all that go to do with me? I take it you wish something of me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Ay, truly. Citizen Prosper; I've
come to ask you for work.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (sarcastically). I would have you
mark that there are no aunts to murder in my place&#8212;this is a house of
entertainment.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Oh, I found the once quite
enough. I want to become a respectable member of society&#8212;I was recommended to
come to you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. By whom, if I may ask?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. A charming young man whom they
put in my cell three days ago. Now he's alone. His name's Gaston!... and you
know him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Gaston! Now I know why I've
missed him for three evenings. One of my best interpreters of pickpockets. He
told yarns&#8212;ah! it made 'em split their sides.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Quite so. And now they've nabbed
him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Nabbed&#8212;what do you mean? He
didn't really steal I suppose.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Yes, he did. But it must have
been the first time, for he seems to have gone about it with incredible
clumsiness. Just think of it&#8212;(confidentially)&#8212;just made a grab at the pocket of
a lady in the Boulevard des Capucines, and pulled out her purse&#8212;an absolute
amateur. You inspire me with confidence, Citizen Prosper, and so I'll make a
confession to you. There was a time when I, too, transacted little bits of
business of that sort, but never without my dear father. When I was still a
child, when we all lived together, when my poor aunt was still alive&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What are you moaning for! I think
'tis in bad taste. You ought not to have killed her.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Too late. But the point I was
coming to is&#8212;take me on here. I will do just the opposite of Gaston. He played
the thief and became one&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. I will give you a trial. You will
produce a fine effect with your make-up. And at a given moment you'll just
describe the aunt matter&#8212;how it all happened&#8212;someone or other will be sure to
ask you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. I thank you, Citizen Prosper.
And with regard to my wages&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Tonight you will play on trial,
and I am, therefore, not yet in a position to pay you wages. But you will get
good stuff to eat and drink; and I shall not mind a franc or so for a night's
lodging.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. I thank you. And just introduce
me to your other colleagues as a visitor from the provinces.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Oh, no. We will tell them right
away that you are a real murderer. They will much prefer that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Pardon me. I don't wish to do
anything against my interests, but I don't see why&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. When you have been on the boards
a bit longer, you will understand.</p>

<p class="center">Enter <span class="sc">Scaevola</span> and <span class="sc">
Jules</span>. </p>
<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Good evening, Chief.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. How many times have I got to tell
you that the whole joke falls flat if you call me Chief?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Well, whatever you are, I
don't think we shall play tonight.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. And why?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. The people won't be in the
mood. There's a hellish uproar in the streets, and in front of the Bastille
especially they are yelling like men possessed.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What matters that to us? The
shouting has been going on for months, and our audience hasn't stayed away from
us. It goes on diverting itself just as it did before.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Ay, it has the gaiety of
people who are shortly going to be hanged.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. If only I live to see it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. In the meanwhile, give us
something to drink to get me into the vein. I don't feel at all in the vein
tonight.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. That's often the case with you,
my friend. I must tell you that I was most dissatisfied with you last night.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Why so, if I may ask?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. The story about the burglary was
simply babyish.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Babyish?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. To be sure. Absolutely
incredible. Mere roaring is of no avail.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. I didn't roar.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. You are always roaring. It will
really be necessary for me to rehearse things with you. One can never rely on
your inspirations. Henri is the only one.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Henri&#8212;never anything but
Henri! Henri simply plays to the gallery. My burglary of last night was a
masterpiece. Henri will never do anything as good as that as long as he lives.
If I don't satisfy you, my friend, then I'll just go to a proper theatre.
Anyhow, yours is nothing but a cheap-jack establishment. Hallo! (Notices <span class="sc">
Grain</span>. ) Who is this! He isn't one of our lot, is he? Perhaps you've just
engaged someone? But what a make-up the fellow has!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Calm yourself. 'Tis not a
professional actor. 'Tis a real murderer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Oh, indeed. (Goes up to him.)
Very glad to know you. My name is Scaevola.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. My name is Grain.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Jules</span> has been walking around in the
room the whole time, frequently standing still, like a man tortured inwardly.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What ails you, Jules?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Jules</span>. I am learning my part.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Jules</span>. Remorse. Tonight I am playing a
man who is a prey to remorse. Look at me. What do you think of the furrow in the
forehead here? Do I not look as though all the furies of hell&#8212;(Walks up and
down.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span> (roars). Wine&#8212;wine, here!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Calm yourself.... There is no
audience yet.</p>
<p class="center">Enter <span class="sc">Henri</span> and <span class="sc">
Léocadie</span>. </p>
<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Good evening. (He greets those
sitting at the back with a light wave of his hand.) Good evening, gentlemen.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Good evening, Henri. What do I
see?&#8212;you and Léocadie together?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span> (who has noticed <span class="sc">
Léocadie</span>, to <span class="sc">Scaevola</span>). Why, I know her. (Speaks
softly with the others.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. Yes, my dear Prosper, it is
I.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. I have not seen you for a year on
end. Let me greet you. (He tries to kiss her.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Stop that. (His eyes often rest
on <span class="sc">Léocadie</span> with pride and passion, but also a certain
anxiety.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. But, Henri&#8212;as between old
comrades&#8212;your old chief Léocadie!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. Oh, the good old times.
Prosper!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What are you sighing about? When
a wench has made her way in the way you have! No doubt about it, a pretty young
woman has always a much easier time of it than we have.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span> (wild with rage). Stop it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Why the deuce do you keep on
shouting at me like that? Because you've picked up with her once more?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Hold your tongue&#8212;she became my
wife yesterday.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Your ...? (To <span class="sc">
Léocadie</span>. ) Is he joking?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. He has really married me.
Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Then I congratulate you.... I
say, Scaevola, Jules, Henri is married.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span> (comes to the front). I wish
you joy (winks at <span class="sc">Léocadie</span>).</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Jules</span> shakes hands with them both.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span> (to <span class="sc">Host</span>). Ah! How
strange! I saw that woman&#8212;a few minutes after I was let out.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. She was the first pretty woman
I'd seen for two years. I was very moved. But it was another gentleman with
whom&#8212; (Goes on speaking to <span class="sc">Host</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span> (in an exalted tone as though
inspired, but not theatrically). Léocadie, my love, my wife ... all the past is
over now. A great deal is blotted out on an occasion like this.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Scaevola</span> and <span class="sc">Jules</span>
have gone to the back. <span class="sc">Host</span>
        comes forward again.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What sort of occasion?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. We are united now by a holy
sacrament. That means more than any human oath. God is now watching over us, and
one ought to forget everything which has happened before. Léocadie, a new age is
dawning. Everything becomes holy now, Léocadie. Our kisses, however wild they
may be, are holy from henceforth. Léocadie, my love, my wife! (He contemplates
her with an ardent glance.) Isn't her expression quite different. Prosper, from
what you ever knew her to have before? Is not her forehead pure! What has been
is blotted out&#8212;not so, Léocadie?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. Surely, Henri.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. And all is well. We leave Paris
tomorrow. Léocadie makes her last appearance tonight at the Porte St. Martin,
and I am placing here tonight for the last time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Are you mad, Henri? Do you want
to desert me? Besides, the manager of the Porte St. Martin will never think of
letting Léocadie go away. Why, she makes the fortune of his house. The young
gentlemen stream thither, so they say.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Hold your peace. Léocadie will
go with me. She will never desert me. Tell me that you will never desert me,
Léocadie. (Brutally.) Tell me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. I will never desert you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. If you did, I would ... (pause).
I am sick of this life. I want quiet&#8212;I wish to have quiet.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. But what do you want to do then,
Henri? It is quite ridiculous. I will make you a proposition. So far as I am
concerned, take Léocadie from the Porte St. Martin, but let her stay here with
me. I will engage her. Anyway, I have rather a dearth of talented women
characters.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. My mind is made up. Prosper. We
are leaving town. We are going into the country.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Into the country? But where?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. To my old father, who lives
alone in our poor village&#8212;I haven't seen him for seven years. He has almost
given up hope of ever seeing his lost son again. He will welcome me with joy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Prosper</span>. What will you do in the
country? In the country they all starve. People are a thousand times worse off
there than in town. What on earth will you do there? You are not the man to till
the fields. Don't imagine you are.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Time will prove that I am the
man to do even that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Soon there won't be any corn
growing in any part of France. You are going to certain misery.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. To happiness. Prosper. Not so,
Léocadie? We have often dreamt of it. I yearn for the peace of the wide plains.
Yes, Prosper, I have seen myself in my dreams going over the fields with her, in
an infinite stillness with the wonderful placid heavens over us. Ay, we will
flee from this awful and dangerous town; the great peace will come over us. Is
it not true, Léocadie, that we have often had such dreams?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. Yes, we have often had such
dreams.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Look here, Henri, you should
consider it. I will gladly raise your wages and I will give Léocadie quite as
much as you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. Hear you that, Henri?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. I really don't know who's to take
your place here. Not a single one of my people has such precious inspirations as
you have, not one of them is so popular with my audience as you ... don't go
away.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. I can quite believe that no one
will take my place.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Stay by me, Henri. (Throws <span class="sc">
Léocadie</span> a look; she intimates that she will arrange matters.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. And I can promise you that they
will take my departure to heart&#8212;they, not I. For tonight&#8212;for my final appearance
I have reserved something that will make them all shudder ... a foreboding of
the end of this world will come over them ... for the end of their world is
nigh. But I shall only experience it from a safe distance ... they will tell us
about it out there, Léocadie, many days after it has happened.... But I tell
you, they will shudder. And you yourself will say, &quot;Henri has never played so
well.&quot;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What are you going to play? What?
Do you know what, Léocadie?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. I never know anything.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. But has anyone any idea of what
an artist lies hidden within me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. They certainly have an idea, and
that's why I tell you that a man with a talent such as yours doesn't go and bury
himself in the country. What an injustice to yourself! and to Art!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. I don't care a straw about Art.
I wish for quiet. You don't understand that, Prosper; you have never loved&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Oh!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. As I love. I want to be alone
with her&#8212;that's the only way ... that's the only way, Léocadie, of forgetting
everything. But then we shall be happier than human beings have ever been
before. We shall have children; you will be a good mother, Léocadie, and a true
wife. All the past, all the past will be blotted out. (Great pause.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. 'Tis getting late, Henri. I
must go to the theatre. Farewell, Prosper; I am glad at last to have seen your
famous den, the place where Henri scores such triumphs.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. But why did you never come?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. Henri would not let
me&#8212;because I should have to sit next to the young men, you know.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span> (has gone to the back). Give me a
drink, Scaevola. (He drinks.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (to <span class="sc">Léocadie</span>,
when <span class="sc">Henri</span> is out of hearing). Henri is an arrant
fool&#8212;if you had only sat next to them!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. Now then! no remarks of that
sort.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Take my tip and be careful, you
silly gutter-brat. He will kill you one of these days.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. What's up, then?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. You were seen only yesterday with
one of your fellows.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. That was not a fellow, you
blockhead; that was&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span> (turns round quickly). What's the
matter with you? No jokes, if you don't mind. No more whispering. No more
secrets now. She is my wife.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What did you give her for a
wedding present?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. Heavens! he never thinks
about such things.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Well, you shall have one this
very night.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. What?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span> and <span class="sc">Jules</span>.
What are you going to give her?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span> (quite seriously). When you have
finished your scene, you must come here and see me act. (They laugh.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. No woman ever had a more
glorious wedding present. Come, Léocadie. Good-by for the present, Prosper. I
shall soon be back again.</p>
<p class="right">[Exeunt <span class="sc">Henri</span> and <span class="sc">
Léocadie</span>. ]</p>

<p class="center">Enter together <span class="sc">François</span>, Vicomte de
Nogeant, and <span class="sc">Albin</span>, Chevalier de la Tremouille.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. What a contemptible braggart!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Good evening, you swine. [<span class="sc">Albin</span>
starts back.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span> (without taking any notice).
Was not that the little Léocadie of the Porte St. Martin, who went away with
Henri?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Of course it was.&#8212;If she really
took great trouble she could eventually make you remember that even you are
something of a man, eh?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span> (laughing). That is not
impossible. It seems we are rather early tonight.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. In the meanwhile you can amuse
yourself with your minion.</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Albin</span> is on the point of flying into a
passion.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Let it pass. I told you what
went on here. Bring us wine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Ay, that I will. The time will
soon come when you will be very satisfied with Seine water.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Quite so, quite so ... but
tonight I would fain ask for wine, and the best wine into the bargain.</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Host</span> goes to the bar.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. That is really a dreadful
fellow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. But just think, it's all a
joke. And, withal, there are places where you can hear similar things in real
earnest.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Is it not forbidden?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span> (laughs). One sees that you
come from the provinces.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Ah! we, too, are having a bad
time of it nowadays. The peasants are getting so insolent ... one doesn't know
what to do any more....</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. What would you have? The poor
devils are hungry&#8212;that is the secret.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. How can I help it? How can my
great-uncle help it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Why do you mention your
great-uncle?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Well, I do so because they
actually held a meeting in our village&#8212;quite openly&#8212;and at the meeting they
actually called my great-uncle, the Comte de Tremouille, a corn-usurer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Is that all?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Nay, is that not enough!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. We will go to the
Palais-Royal tomorrow, and there you will have a chance of hearing the monstrous
speeches the fellows make. But we let them speak&#8212;it is the best thing to do.
They are good people at bottom; one must let them bawl themselves out in that
way.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span> (pointing to <span class="sc">
Scaevola</span>, etc.). What suspicious characters those are! Just see how they
look at one. (He feels for his sword.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span> (draws his hand away). Don't
be ridiculous. (To the three others.) You need not begin yet; wait till there is
more audience. (To <span class="sc">Albin</span>. ) They're the most respectable
people in the world, actors are. I will warrant you have already sat at table
with worse knaves.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. But they were better attired. [<span class="sc">Host</span>
brings wine.]</p>

<p class="center">Enter <span class="sc">Michette</span> and <span class="sc">
Flipotte</span>. </p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. God be with you, children!
Come and sit down by us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. Here we are. Come along,
Flipotte. She is still somewhat shy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Flipotte</span>. Good evening, young
gentleman.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Good evening, ladies.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. The little one is a dear.
(She sits on <span class="sc">Albin's</span> lap.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. But, François, please explain,
are these respectable ladies?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. What does he say?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. No, that's not quite the word
for the ladies who come here. Odds life, you are silly, Albin!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. What shall I bring for their
Graces?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. Bring me a very sweet wine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span> (pointing to <span class="sc">
Flipotte</span>). A friend of yours?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. We live together. Yes, we
have only one bed between us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Flipotte</span> (blushing). Would you find it
a very great nuisance should you come and see her! (Sits on <span class="sc">
François's</span> lap.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. She is not at all shy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span> (stands up; gloomily turning
to the table where the young people are). At last I've found you. (To <span class="sc">

She is mine.</p>

a joke&#8212;a joke....</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. She isn't his&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. Go away. You let me sit where
I want to.</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Scaevola</span> stands there with clenched
fists.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (behind). Now, now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Ha, ha!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (takes him by the collar). Ha, ha!
(By his side.) You have not a farthing's worth of talent. Roaring, that's the
only thing you can do.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span> (to <span class="sc">François</span>).
Recently he did it much better.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span> (to <span class="sc">Host</span>).
I'm not in the vein. I'll make a better show later on, when more people are
here; you see. Prosper, I need an audience.</p>

<p class="center">Enter the DUC DE CADIGNAN.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Already in full swing!</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Michette</span> and <span class="sc">Flipotte</span>
go up to him.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. My sweet Duke.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Good evening, <span class="sc">
Emile</span> ... (introducing) My young friend, Albin, Chevalier de
Tremouille&#8212;the Duc de Cadignan.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. I am delighted to make your
acquaintance. (To the girls, who are hanging on to him.) Leave me alone,
children! (To <span class="sc">Albin</span>. ) So you, too, are having a look at
this droll tavern?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. It bewilders me in the extreme.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. The Chevalier has only been
in Paris a few days.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span> (laughing). Then you have
certainly chosen a nice time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. How so?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. He still has that delicious
perfume! There isn't another man in Paris who has such a pleasant smell. (To <span class="sc">
Albin</span>. ) ... You can't perceive it like that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. She speaks of the seven or eight
hundred whom she knows as well as me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Flipotte</span>. Will you let me play with
your sword, dear?</p>
<p class="hang2">[She draws his sword out of its sheath and flashes it about.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span> (to Host). He's the man&#8212;'twas him
I saw her with&#8212;</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Host</span> lets him go on, seems
astonished.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Henri is not here yet, then? (To <span class="sc">
Albin</span>. ) If you see him, you will not regret having come here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (to <span class="sc">Duke</span>).
Oh, so you're here again, are you? I am glad. We shall not have the pleasure
much longer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Why? I find it very nice at your
place.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. I believe that. But since in any
case you will be one of the first ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. What does that mean!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. You understand me well enough.
The favorites of fortune will be the first! (Goes to the back.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span> (after reflection). If I were
king, I would make him my Court Fool; I mean to say, I should have many Court
Fools, but he would be one of them.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. What did he mean by saying that
you were too fortunate?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. He means, Chevalier ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Please, don't call me Chevalier.
Everybody calls me Albin, simply Albin, just because I look so young.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span> (smiling). Good.... But you must
call me Emile&#8212;eh?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. With pleasure, if you allow it,
Emile.</p>

<p class="center">HENRIK IBSEN.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. They have a sinister wit, have
these people.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Why sinister? I find it quite
reassuring. So long as the mob is in the mood for jests, it will never come to
anything serious.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Only the jests are much too
strange. I learnt a thing today that gives food for thought.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Tell us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Flipotte</span> and <span class="sc">Michette</span>.
Ay, tell us, sweet Duke!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Do you know Lelange?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Of course&#8212;the village ... the
Marquis de Montferrat has one of his finest hunts there.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Quite right; my brother is now at
the castle with him, and he has written home about the things I am going to tell
you. They have a mayor at Lelange who is very unpopular.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. If you can tell me the name
of one who is popular&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Just listen. The women of the
village paraded in front of the mayor's house with a coffin.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Flipotte</span>. What? Did they carry it?
Carry a coffin? I wouldn't like to carry a coffin for anything in the world.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Hold your tongue. Nobody is
asking you to carry a coffin. (To the <span class="sc">Duke</span>. ) Well?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. And one or two of the women went
into the mayor's house and explained to him that he must die, but they would do
him the honor of burying him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Well, have they killed him?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. No; at least, my brother doesn't
write anything about it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Well then ... blusterers,
talkers, clowns&#8212;that's what they are. Today they're roaring in Paris at the
Bastille for a change, just as they've already done half a dozen times before
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Well, if I were king I should
have made an end of it long ago.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Is it true that the king is so
good-natured?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. You have not yet been presented
to His Majesty?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. This is the first time the
Chevalier has been in Paris.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Yes, you are incredibly young.
How old, if I may ask?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. I only look so young; I am
already seventeen.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Seventeen!&#8212;how much is still in
front of you! I am already four-and-twenty!... I am beginning to regret how much
of my youth I have missed!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span> (laughs). That is good. You,
Duke&#8212;you count every day lost in which you have not conquered a woman or killed
a man.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Only the unfortunate thing is
that one never makes a conquest of the right woman, and always kills the wrong
man. And that as a matter of fact is how one misses one's youth. You know what
Rollin says?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. What does Rollin say?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. I was thinking of his new piece
that they are playing at the Comédie&#8212;there is such a pretty simile in it. Don't
you remember?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. I have no memory for verses.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Nor have I, unfortunately ... I
only remember the sense. He says, youth which a man does not enjoy is like a
feather-ball, which you leave lying in the sand instead of throwing it up into
the air.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span> (like a wiseacre). I think that
is quite right.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Is it not true? The feathers
gradually lose their color and fall out. 'Tis better for it to fall into a bush
where it cannot be found.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. How should one understand that,
Emile?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. 'Tis more a matter of feeling
than of understanding. If I could repeat the verses, you would understand it at
once.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. I have an idea, Emile, that you,
too, could make verses if you wished.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Why?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Since you have been here, it
seems to me as though life were flaming up.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span> (smiling). Yes? Is life flaming
up?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Won't you come and sit with
us after all?</p>
<p class="hang2">[Meanwhile, two nobles come in and sit down at a distant table. <span class="sc">
Host</span> appears to be addressing insults to them.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. I cannot stay here. But in any
case I will come back again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. Stay with me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Flipotte</span>. Take me with you. (They try
to hold him.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (coming to the front). Just you
leave him alone. You're not bad enough for him by a long way. He's got to run
after a whore off the streets&#8212;that's where he feels most in his element.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. I shall certainly come back, if
only not to miss Henri.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. What do you think, when we
came, Henri was just going out with Léocadie.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Really&#8212;he has married her. Did
you know that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Is that so? What will the
others have to say to it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. What others?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. She is loved all around, you
know.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. And he wants to go away with her
... what do I know about it?... Somebody told me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Indeed? Did they tell you?
(Glances at the <span class="sc">Duke</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span> (having first looked at <span class="sc">
Host</span>). It is too silly. Léocadie was made to be the greatest, the most
splendid whore in the world.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Who doesn't know that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. Could anything be more
unreasonable than to take people away from their true calling? (As <span class="sc">
François</span> laughs.) I am not joking. Whores are born, not made&#8212;just as
conquerors and poets are.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. You are paradoxical.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span>. I am sorry for her, and for
Henri. He should stay here&#8212;no, not here&#8212;I should like to bring him to the
Comédie&#8212;though even there&#8212;I always feel as though nobody understood him as well
as I do. Of course, that may be an illusion, since I have the same feeling in
regard to most artists. But I must say if I were not the Duc de Cadignan, I
should really like to be a comedian like him&#8212;like him, I say ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Like Alexander the Great.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Duke</span> (smiling). Yes, Alexander the
Great.... (To <span class="sc">Flipotte</span>. ) Give me my sword. (He puts it
in the sheath. Slowly.) It is the finest way of making fun of the world; a man
who can play any part and at the same time play us is greater than all of us. (<span class="sc">Albin</span>
looks at him in astonishment.) Don't you reflect on what I say. 'Tis all only
true at the actual moment. Good-by.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. Give me a kiss before you go.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Flipotte</span>. Me too!</p>
<p class="hang2">[They hang on to him, the Duke kisses them both at once and
goes. In the meanwhile:]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. a wonderful man!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. That is quite true; ... but
the existence of men like that is almost a reason for not marrying.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. But do explain; what are those
girls?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Actresses. They, too, belong
to the troupe of Prosper, who is at present the host of the tavern. No doubt
they've done in the past much the same as they're doing now.</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Guillaume</span> rushes in apparently
breathless.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Guillaume</span> (making toward the table
where the actors are sitting, with his hand on his heart&#8212;speaking with
difficulty&#8212;supporting himself). Saved&#8212;ay, saved!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. What is it? What ails you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. What has happened to the man?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. That is part of the acting
now. Mark you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Ah!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">
Flipotte</span> (going quickly to <span class="sc">Guillaume</span>). What is
it? What ails you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Sit down. Take a draught!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Guillaume</span>. More!&#8212;more! Prosper, more
wine! I have been running. My tongue cleaves to my mouth. They were right at my
heels.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Jules</span> (gives a start). Ah! be careful;
they really are at our heels.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Come, tell us, what happened
then? (To the actors.) Movement!&#8212;more movement!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Guillaume</span>. Women here ... women&#8212;ah!
(Embraces <span class="sc">Flipotte</span>. ) That brings one back to life again!
(To <span class="sc">Albin</span>, who is highly impressed.) The Devil take me,
my boy, if I thought I would ever see you alive again. (As though he were
listening.) They come!&#8212;they come! (Goes to the door.) No, it is nothing ... They
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. How strange! There really is a
noise, as though people outside were pressing forward very quickly. Is that part
of the stage effects as well?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. He goes in for such damned
subtleties every blessed time. (To <span class="sc">Jules</span>. ) 'Tis too
silly&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Come now, tell us why they are at
your heels again?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Guillaume</span>. Oh, nothing special. But if
they got me, it would cost me my head. I've set fire to a house.</p>
<p class="hang2">[During this scene young nobles come in and sit down at the
tables.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (softly). Go on!&#8212;go on!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Guillaume</span> (in the same tone). What more
do you want? Isn't it enough for you if I've set fire to a house?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. But tell me, my friend, why
you set fire to the house.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Guillaume</span>. Because the President of the
Supreme Court lived in it. We wanted to make a beginning with him. We wanted to
keep the good Parisian householders from taking folk into their houses so
lightly who send us poor devils to the prison.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. That's good! That's good!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Guillaume</span> (looks at <span class="sc">
Grain</span> and is surprised; then goes on speaking). All the houses must be
fired. Three more fellows like me and there won't be any more judges in Paris.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. Death to the judges!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Jules</span>. Yes ... but there may be one
whom we can't annihilate.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Guillaume</span>. I should like to know who he
is.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Jules</span>. The judge within us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (softly). That's tasteless. Leave
off. Scaevola, roar! Now's the time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Wine here, Prosper; we want
to drink to the death of all the judges in France.</p>
<p class="hang2">[During the last words enter the <span class="sc">Marquis de
Lansac</span>, with his wife, <span class="sc">Séverine</span>, and <span class="sc">
Rollin</span>, the poet.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Death to all who have the
power in their hands today!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. See you, Séverine, that is how
they greet us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. Marquise, I warned you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Why?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Whom do I see? The Marquise!
Allow me to kiss your hand. Good evening. Marquis. Well met to you, Rollin. And
you, Marquise, you dare to venture into this place!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. I heard such a lot about it.
And besides, we are having a day of adventures already&#8212;eh, Rollin?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. Yes. Just think of it,
Vicomte; you would never believe where we come from&#8212;from the Bastille.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Are they still keeping up the
tumult there?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Ay, indeed! It looks as
though they meant to storm it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span> (declaiming). Like to a flood
that seethes against its banks, And rages deep that its own child, the Earth,
Resists it.&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Don't, Rollin! We left our
carriages there in the neighborhood. It is a magnificent spectacle&#8212;there is
always something so grand about crowds.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Yes, yes, if they only did
not smell so vilely.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. And my wife would not leave me
in peace&#8212;I had to bring her here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Well, what is there so very
special here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (to <span class="sc">Lansac</span>).
Well, so you're here, are you, you dried-up old scoundrel? Did you bring your
wife along because she wasn't safe enough for you at home?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span> (with a forced laugh). He's
quite a character.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. But take heed that she is not
snatched away from under your nose in this very place. Aristocratic ladies like
her very often get a deuce of a fancy to try what a real rogue is like.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. I suffer unspeakably, Séverine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. My child, I prepared you for
this&#8212;it is high time that we went.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. What ails you? I think it's
charming. Nay, let us seat ourselves.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Would you allow me. Marquise,
to present to you the Chevalier de la Tremouille. He is here for the first time,
too. The Marquis de Lansac; Rollin, our celebrated poet.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Delighted. (Compliments; they
sit down.) (To <span class="sc">François</span>. ) Is that one of those that are
playing, or&#8212;I can't make it out&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Don't be so stupid. That is
the lawful wife of the Marquis de Lansac ... a lady of extreme propriety.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span> (to <span class="sc">Séverine</span>).
Say that thou lovest me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Yes, yes; but ask me not
every minute.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. Have we missed a scene
already?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Nothing much. An incendiary's
playing over there, 'twould appear.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Chevalier, you must be the
cousin of the little Lydia de la Tremouille who was married today.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Quite so, Marquise; that was one
of the reasons why I came to Paris.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. I remember having seen you in
the church.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span> (embarrassed). I am highly
flattered, Marquise.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span> (to <span class="sc">Rollin</span>).
What a dear little boy!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. My dear Séverine, you have
never yet managed to know a man without his pleasing you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Indeed I did; and what is
more, I married him straight away.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. I am always so afraid,
Séverine&#8212;I am sure there are moments when it's not safe for you to be with your
own husband.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (brings wine). There you are. I
wish it were poison; but for the time being, the law won't let us serve it to
you, you scum.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. The time'll soon come,
Prosper.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span> (to <span class="sc">Rollin</span>).
What is the matter with both those pretty girls? Why don't they come nearer? Now
that we once are here, I want to join in everything. I really think that
everything is extremely moral here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. Have patience, Séverine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. I think nowadays one diverts
oneself best in the streets. Do you know what happened to us yesterday when we
went for a drive in the Promenade de Longchamps?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. Please, please, my dear
Séverine, why&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. A fellow jumped onto the
footboard of our carriage and shouted, &quot;Next year you will stand behind your
coachman and we shall be sitting in the carriages.&quot;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Hm! That is rather strong.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. Odds life! I don't think one
ought to talk of such things. Paris is now somewhat feverish, but that will soon
pass off again.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Guillaume</span> (suddenly). I see
flames&#8212;flames everywhere I look&#8212;red, high flames.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (to him). You're playing a madman,
not a criminal.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Does he see flames?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. But all this is still not the
real thing. Marquise.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span> (to <span class="sc">Rollin</span>).
I cannot tell you how bewildered I feel already with everything.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span> (comes to the <span class="sc">
Marquis</span>). I have not yet greeted you, darling, you dear old pig.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span> (embarrassed). She jests, dear
Séverine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. It does not look that way.
Tell me, little one, how many love-affairs have you had so far?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span> (to <span class="sc">François</span>).
It is really wonderful how well my wife the Marquise knows how to adapt herself
to every situation.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. Yes, it is wonderful.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. Have you counted yours?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. When I was still as young as
you ... of course ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span> (to <span class="sc">Rollin</span>).
Tell me, M. Rollin, is the Marquise joking, or is she really like&#8212;? I positively
can't make it out.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. Reality ... playing ... do you
know the difference so exactly. Chevalier?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. At any rate ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. I don't. And what I find so
peculiar here is that all apparent distinctions, so to speak, are taken away.
Reality passes into play&#8212;play into reality. Just look now at the Marquise. How
she gossips with those creatures as though she were one of them. At the same
time she is&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Something quite different.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. I thank you, Chevalier.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (to <span class="sc">Grain</span>).
Well, how did it all happen?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. What?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Why, the affair with your aunt,
for which you went to prison for two years.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. I told you, I strangled her.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. That is feeble. He is an
amateur. I have never seen him before.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span> (comes quickly in, dressed
like a prostitute of the lowest class). Good evening, children. Is my Balthasar
not here yet?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Georgette, sit by me. Your
Balthasar will yet be here in time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span>. If he is not here in ten
minutes, he won't bring off anything again&#8212;he won't come back at all then.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Watch her, Marquise. She is
the wife of that Balthasar of whom she has just been speaking, and who will soon
come in. She represents just a common street-jade, while Balthasar is her bully.
All the same, she is the truest wife to be found in the whole of Paris.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span> comes in.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span>. My Balthasar! (She runs
toward him and embraces him). So there you are.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span>. It is all in order. (Silence
around him.) It was not worth the trouble. I was almost sorry for him. You
should size up your customers better, Georgette. I am sick of killing promising
youths for the sake of a few francs.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Splendid!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. What&#8212;?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. He brings out the points so
well.</p>

<p class="center">Enter the <span class="sc">Commissaire</span>, disguised; sits
down at table.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (to him). You come at a good time,
M. le Commissaire. This is one of my best exponents.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span>. One should really try and
find another profession. On my soul, I am not a craven, but this kind of bread
is hard earned.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. I can well believe so.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span>. What's the matter with you
today?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span>. I will tell you what.
Georgette&#8212;I think you're a trifle too tender with the young gentlemen.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span>. See what a child he is! But
be reasonable, Balthasar. I must needs be very tender so as to inspire them with
confidence.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. What she says is really deep.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span>. If I thought for a moment
that you felt anything when another&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span>. What do you say to that?
Dumb jealousy will yet bring him to his grave.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span>. I have already heard one
sigh, Georgette, and that was at a moment when one of them was already giving
sufficient proofs of his confidence.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span>. One can't leave off playing
a woman in love so suddenly.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span>. Be careful, Georgette&#8212;the
Seine is deep. (Wildly.) Should you ever deceive me&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span>. Never, never.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. I positively can't make it out.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Rollin, that is the right
interpretation!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. You think so?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span> (to <span class="sc">Séverine</span>).
It is time we were going, Séverine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Why? I am beginning to enjoy
it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span>. My Balthasar, I adore you.
(Embrace.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Bravo! bravo!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span>. What loony is that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span>. This is unquestionably too
strong; this is&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1">Enter <span class="sc">Maurice</span> and <span class="sc">
Etienne</span>. They are dressed like young nobles, but one can see that they
are only disguised in dilapidated theatrical costumes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">From the Actors' Table</span>. Who are they?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. May the devil take me if it
ain't Maurice and Etienne.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Georgette</span>. Of course it is they!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span>. Georgette!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Heavens! what monstrously
pretty young persons.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. It is painful, Séverine, to see
you so violently excited by every pretty face.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. What did I come here for,
then?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. Tell me, at any rate, that you
love me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span> (with a peculiar look). You
have a short memory.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Etienne</span>. Well, where do you think we
have come from?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Listen, Marquis; they're a
couple of quite witty youths.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Maurice</span>. A wedding.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Etienne</span>. One has got to dress up a bit
in places like this. Otherwise one of those damned secret police gets on one's
track at once.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. At any rate, have you made a
good haul?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Let's have a look.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Maurice</span> (drawing watches out of his
waistcoat). What'll you give me for this?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. For that there? A louis.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Maurice</span>. Indeed?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. It is not worth more.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. That is a lady's watch. Give
it to me, Maurice.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Maurice</span>. What will you give me for't?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. Look at me&#8212;isn't that enough?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Flipotte</span>. No, give it to me; look at
me&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Maurice</span>. My dear children, I can have
that without risking my head.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. You are a conceited ape.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. I swear that's no acting.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. Of course not; there is a flash
of reality running through the whole thing. That is the chief charm.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. What wedding was it, then?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Maurice</span>. The wedding of Mademoiselle de
la Tremouille; she was married to the Comte de Banville.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Do you hear that, François? I
assure you they are real knaves.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Calm yourself, Albin. I know
the two. I have seen them play a dozen times already. Their specialty is the
portrayal of pickpockets.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Maurice</span> draws some purses out of his
waistcoat.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Well, you can do the handsome
tonight.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Etienne</span>. It was a very magnificent
wedding. All the nobility of France was there. Even the King was represented.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span> (excited). All that is true.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Maurice</span> (rolls some money over the
table). That is for you, my friends, so that you can see that we all stick to
one another.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Properties, dear Albin. (He
stands up and takes a few coins.) We, too, you see, come in for a share.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. You take it&#8212;you have never earned
anything so honestly in your life.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Maurice</span> (holds in the air a garter set
with diamonds). And to whom shall I give this? (<span class="sc">Georgette</span>, <span class="sc">
Michette</span>, and <span class="sc">Flipotte</span> make a rush after it.)
Patience, you sweet pusses. We will speak about that later on. I will give it to
the one who devises a new caress.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span> (to <span class="sc">Rollin</span>).
Would you not like to let me join in the competition!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. I protest you will drive me
mad, Séverine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. Séverine, had we not better be
going now? I think&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Oh, no. I am enjoying myself
excellently. (To
<span class="sc">Rollin</span>. ) Ah well, my mood is getting so&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Michette</span>. How did you get hold of the
garter?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Maurice</span>. There was such a crush in the
church&#8212;and when a lady thinks one is courting her&#8212; (All laugh.)</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Grain</span> has stolen <span class="sc">
François's</span> purse.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span> (showing the money to <span class="sc">
Albin</span>). Mere counters. Are you satisfied now? [<span class="sc">Grain</span>
wants to get away.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (going after him softly). Give me
the purse at once which you took from this gentleman.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. I&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Straightaway ... or it will be
the worse for you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grain</span>. You need not be churlish. (Gives
it to him.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. And stay here. I have no time to
search you now. Who knows what else you have pouched. Go back to your place.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Flipotte</span>. I shall win the garter.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (throwing the purse to <span class="sc">
François</span>). Here's your purse. You lost it out of your pocket.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. I thank you, Prosper. (To <span class="sc">
Albin</span>. ) You see, we are in reality in the company of most respectable
people.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Henri</span>, who has already been present
for some time and has sat behind, suddenly stands up.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. Henri&#8212;there is Henri.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Is he the one you told me so
much about?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. Assuredly. The man one really
comes here to see.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Henri</span> comes to the front of the stage,
very theatrically; is silent.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">The Actors</span>. Henri, what ails you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. Observe the look. A world of
passion. You see, he is playing the man who commits a crime of passion.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. I prize that highly.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. But why does he not speak?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. He is beside himself. Just
watch. Pay attention.... He has wrought a fearful deed somewhere.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. He is somewhat theatrical. It
looks as though he were going to get ready for a monologue.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Henri, Henri, where do you come
from?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. I have murdered.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. What did I say?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Whom?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. The lover of my wife.</p>
<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Prosper</span> looks at him; at this moment
he obviously has the feeling that it might be true.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span> (looks up). Well, yes, I've done
it. What are you looking at me like that for? That's how the matter stands. Is
it, then, so wonderful after all? You all know what kind of a creature my wife
is; it was bound to end like that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. And she&#8212;where is she?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. See, the host takes it
seriously. You notice how realistic that makes the thing.</p>
<p class="right">[Noise outside&#8212;not too loud.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Jules</span>. What noise is that outside?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. Do you hear, Séverine?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. It sounds as though troops were
marching by.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Oh, no; it is our dear people
of Paris. Just listen how they bawl. (Uneasiness in the cellar; it grows quiet
outside.) Go on, Henri&#8212;go on.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Yes, do tell us, Henri&#8212;where is
your wife? Where have you left her?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Oh, I have no qualms about her.
She will not die of it. Whether it is this man or that man, what do the women
care? There are still a thousand other handsome men running about Paris&#8212;whether
it is this man or that man&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Balthasar</span>. May it fare thus with all
who take our wives from us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. All who take from us what
belongs to us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Commissaire</span> (to <span class="sc">Host</span>).
These are seditious speeches.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. It is dreadful ... the people
mean it seriously.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scaevola</span>. Down with the usurers of
France! We would fain wager that the fellow whom he caught with his wife was
another again of those accursed hounds who rob us of our bread as well.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. I propose we go.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Henri!&#8212;Henri!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. But, Marquise&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Please, dear Marquis, ask the
man how he caught his wife&#8212;or I will ask him myself.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span> (after resisting). Tell us,
Henri, how did you manage to catch the pair?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span> (who has been for a long while
sunk in reverie). Know you my wife, then? She is the fairest and vilest creature
under the sun. And I loved her! We have known one another for seven years&#8212;but it
is only yesterday that she became my wife. In those seven years there was not
one day, nay, not one day, in which she did not lie to me, for everything about
her is a lie&#8212;her eyes and her lips, her kisses and her smiles.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. He rants a little.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Every boy and every old man,
every one who excited her and every one who paid her&#8212;every one, I think, who
wanted her&#8212;has possessed her, and I have known it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Not every one can boast as
much.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. And all the same she loved me,
my friends. Can any one of you understand that? She always came back to me
again&#8212;from all quarters back again to me&#8212;from the handsome and from the ugly,
from the shrewd and from the foolish, from ragamuffins and from courtiers&#8212;always
came back to me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span> (to <span class="sc">Rollin</span>).
Now, if only you had an inkling that it is just this coming back which is really
love.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. What I suffered ... tortures,
tortures!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. It is harrowing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. And yesterday I married her. We
had a dream&#8212;nay, I had a dream. I wanted to get away with her from here. Into
solitude, into the country, into the great peace. We wished to live like other
happy married couples&#8212;we dreamt also of having a child&#8212;-</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span> (softly). Séverine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Very good!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. François, that man is speaking
the truth.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Quite so; the love-story is
true, but the real pith is the murder-story.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. I was just one day too late....
There was just one man whom she had forgotten, otherwise&#8212;I believe&#8212;she wouldn't
have wanted any one else.... But I caught them together ... it is all over with
him.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Actors</span>. Who?&#8212;who? How did it happen?
Where does he lie? Are you pursued? How did it happen? Where is she?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span> (with growing excitement). I
escorted her ... to the theatre ... today was to be the last time.... I kissed
her ... at the door ... and she went to her dressing-room ... and I went off
like a man who has nothing to fear. But when I had gone a hundred yards, I began
... to have ... within me&#8212;do you understand? ... a terrible unrest ... and it
was as though something forced me to turn round ... and I turned round and went
back. But once there I felt ashamed and went away again ... and again I walked a
hundred yards away from the theatre ... and then something gripped me ... again
I went back. Her scene was at an end&#8212;she hasn't got much to do, she just stands
awhile on the stage half naked&#8212;and then she has finished. I stood in front of
her dressing-room, put my ear to the door, and heard whispers. I could not make
out a word ... the whispering ceased ... I pushed open the door ... (he roars
like a lion) it was the Duc de Cadignan, and I murdered him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (who now at last takes it for the
truth). Madman!</p>
<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Henri</span> looks up, gazes fixedly at <span class="sc">

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Bravo!&#8212;bravo!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. What are you doing. Marquise?
The moment you call out &quot;bravo!&quot; you make it all acting again&#8212;and the pleasant
shudder is past.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. I do not find the shudder so
pleasant. Let us applaud, my friends; that is the only way we can throw off the
spell.</p>
<p class="hang2">[A gentle bravo, growing continually louder; all applaud.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (to <span class="sc">Henri</span>,
during the noise). Save yourself&#8212;flee, Henri.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. What!&#8212;what!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span>. Let this be enough, and see that
you get away.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. Hush!... Let us hear what the
host says.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Host</span> (after a short reflection). I am
telling him that he ought to get away before the watch at the city gates are
informed. The handsome Duke was a favorite of the King&#8212;they will break you on
the wheel. Far better had it been had you stabbed that scum, your wife.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. What playing up to each
other!... Splendid!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Prosper, which of us is mad, you
or I! (He stands there and tries to read in <span class="sc">Prosper's</span>
eyes.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Rollin</span>. It is wonderful; we all know
that he is acting, and yet if the Duc de Cadignan were to enter now, it would be
like a ghost appearing.</p>

husband! (She comes to the front, sees, and shrieks out.) Who has done this?
Henri! [<span class="sc">Henri</span> looks at her.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. Why have you done this?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Henri</span>. Why?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Léocadie</span>. I know why. Because of me.
Nay, nay, say not 'twas because of me. Never in all my life have I been worth
that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span> (begins a speech). Citizens of
Paris, we will celebrate our victory. Chance has led us on our way through the
streets of Paris to this amiable host. It could not have fitted in more
prettily. Nowhere can the cry &quot;Vive la Liberté!&quot; ring sweeter than over the
corpse of a duke.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Voices</span>. Vive la Liberté! Vive la
Liberté!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">François</span>. I think we might go. The
people have gone mad. Let us go.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Albin</span>. Shall we leave the corpse here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span>. Vive la Liberté! Vive la
Liberté!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Marquis</span>. <br> Are you mad?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Citizens</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Actors</span>.
Vive la Liberté! Vive la Liberté!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Séverine</span> (leading the nobles to the
exit). Rollin, wait you tonight outside my window. I will throw the key down
like t'other night. We will pass a pretty hour&#8212;I feel quite pleasurably excited.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Shouts</span>. Vive la Liberté! Vive Henri!
Vive Henri!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Lebrêt</span>. Look at the fellows&#8212;they are
running away from us.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Grasset</span>. Let them for tonight&#8212;let them;
they will not escape us.</p>

<br>

<p class="hang1">Scene, a decently but not richly furnished room, belonging to
<span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Table, small writing-desk, chairs, a cupboard,
two windows up stage, doors right and left. At rise of curtain, <span class="sc">
Clement</span> is discovered leaning against mantelpiece, in a very elegant dark
gray morning suit, smoking a cigarette and reading a newspaper. <span class="sc">
Margaret</span> stands by window, then walks up and down, finally comes behind <span class="sc">
Clement</span> and runs her hands through his hair. She seems rather restless. <span class="sc">
Clement</span> goes on reading, then seizes her hand and kisses it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Horner is sure of his game&#8212;or
rather my game. Waterloo five to one, Barometer twenty to one, Busserl seven to
one, Attila sixteen to one.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Sixteen to one!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Lord Byron six to four&#8212;that's
us, darling!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I know.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Besides, it's still six weeks
to the race.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Apparently he thinks it's a
dead certainty.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. The way she knows all the
terms ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I've known these terms longer
than I have you. And is it quite settled that you'll ride Lord Byron yourself?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. How can you ask? The Ladies'
Plate! Whom else should I put up? If Horner didn't know I was going to ride him
myself, he wouldn't be standing at six to four, you may be sure of that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I believe you. You're so
handsome on horseback&#8212;simply fit to take one's breath away! I shall never forget
how you looked at Munich, the day I got to know you ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Don't remind me of it! I had
awful luck that day. Windisch would never have won the race if he hadn't got ten
lengths start. But this time&#8212;ah ...! And the next day we go away.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. In the evening.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Yes ... But why?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Because in the morning we
shall be getting married, I suppose.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Yes, yes, darling.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I'm so happy! (Embraces him.)
And where shall we go?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I thought we'd agreed about
that&#8212;to my place in the country.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes, later. But can't we have
a little while on the Riviera first?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. That'll depend on the Ladies'
Plate; if I win it ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Dead certainty!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. And anyhow, in April the
Riviera really isn't the thing any more.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, that's it, is it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Of course that's it, child.
You've retained from your old life certain conceptions of what's the thing which
are&#8212;you'll forgive me for saying it&#8212;just a little like those of the comic
papers.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Really, Clement ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh well, we'll see. (Goes on
reading.) Badegast fifteen to one ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Badegast? He won't be in it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Szigrati himself told me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. How was that? Where?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Why, yesterday up at the
Freudenau, while you were talking to Milner.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. To my way of thinking,
Szigrati isn't the right sort of company for you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Jealous?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Nonsense! Anyhow, after this I
shall introduce you everywhere as my fiancée. (She kisses him.) Well, what did
Szigrati tell you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. That he wasn't going to enter
Badegast for the Ladies' Plate.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh, you mustn't believe
everything Szigrati tells you. He's spreading the report that Badegast won't run
just in order that the odds may be longer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Why, that's just like
speculation.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Well, don't you suppose we've
got any speculators among us? For many men the whole thing is a business. Do you
suppose a man like Szigrati has the slightest feeling for sport? He might just
as well be on the stock exchange. But for the matter of that, as far as Badegast
is concerned, people might well lay a hundred to one against him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh? I thought he looked
splendid this morning.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh, she's seen Badegast too!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. To be sure&#8212;didn't Butters
give him a gallop this morning after Busserl?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. But Butters doesn't ride for
Szigrati. That must have been a stable-boy. Well, anyhow, Badegast may look as
splendid as you like, it makes no difference&#8212;he's no good. Ah, Margaret, with
your brains you'll soon learn to distinguish real greatness from false. It's
really incredible, the quickness with which you've already&#8212;what shall I
say?&#8212;initiated yourself into all these things&#8212;it surpasses my boldest
expectations.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (annoyed). Why does it surpass
your expectations? You know very well that all these things are not so new to
me. Some very good people used to visit my parents' house&#8212;Count Libowski and
various others; and also at my husband's ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh, of course&#8212;I know ... At
bottom I've really got nothing against the cotton business.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What has it to do with my
personal views that my husband had a cotton factory? I always continued my
education in my own fashion. But let's not talk any further about those
days&#8212;they're far enough away, thank God!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. But there are others that are
nearer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. To be sure. But what does
that mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh, I only mean that in your
Munich surroundings you can't have heard much of sporting matters, as far as I
am able to judge.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I wish you'd stop reproaching
me with the surroundings in which you learned to know me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Reproaching you? There can't
be any question of that. But it has always been and still is incomprehensible to
me how you got in with those people.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You talk exactly as if they
had been a gang of criminals!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Child, I give you my word,
there were some of them that looked exactly like highway-robbers. What I can't
understand is how you, with your well-developed sense of ... Well, I won't say
anything more than your taste for ... cleanliness and nice perfumes ... could
bear living among those people, sitting down at the table with them.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (smiling). Didn't you do it
too?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I sat down near them&#8212;not with
them. And you know it was for your sake, exclusively for your sake, that I did
it. I won't deny that some of them improved on closer acquaintance; there were
some really interesting people among them. And you mustn't get the idea,
darling, that when I'm among ill-dressed people I have a feeling of conscious
superiority. It's not that&#8212;but there's something in their whole bearing, in
their very nature, that makes one nervous.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, I think that's rather a
sweeping statement.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Now don't get offended with
me, darling. I've just said there were some very interesting people among them.
But how a <i>lady</i> can feel at home with them for any length of time, I shall
never be able to understand.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You forget one thing, my dear
Clement&#8212;that in a certain sense I belong to their circle, or did belong to it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. You&#8212;I beg your pardon!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. They were artists.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Ah good&#8212;we're back on that
subject again!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes&#8212;and that's the thing that
always hurts me, that you can't feel with me there.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. &quot;Can't feel with you&quot; ... I
like that! I can feel with you all right&#8212;but you know what it was I always
disliked about your scribbling, and you know that it's a very personal thing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Well, there are women who in
my situation at that time would have done worse things than write poetry.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. But such poetry! (He picks up
a little book on the mantelpiece.) That's the whole question. I can assure you,
every time I see it lying there, every-time I even think of it, I'm ashamed to
think it's yours.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You simply don't understand
it. No, you mustn't be vexed with me; if you had just that one thing more, you'd
be perfect&#8212;and that probably is not to be. But what is it that disturbs you in
the verses? You surely know that I haven't experienced anything like that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I hope not!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You know it's all
imagination.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. But then I can't help asking
myself ... how comes a lady to have such an imagination? (Reads.)</p>

<p class="hang4" style="margin-left:8em">           &quot;So, drunk with bliss, I
hang upon thy neck And suck thy lips' drained sweetness ...&quot;</p>

<p class="hang4">(Shakes his head.) How can a lady write such stuff, or allow it
to be printed? Everybody who reads it must call up a picture of the authoress
and the neck and ... the intoxication.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. When I give you my word that
such a neck has never existed ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. No, I can't believe that it
has. Lucky for me that I can't&#8212;and ... for you too, Margaret. But how did you
ever come by such fancies? All these glowing emotions can't possibly be referred
to your first husband&#8212;you told me yourself he never understood you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Of course he didn't&#8212;that's
why I got a divorce from him. You know all about that. I simply couldn't exist
by the side of a man who had no ideas beyond eating and drinking and cotton.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Yes, I know. But all that's
three years ago&#8212;and you wrote the verses later.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes ... But just think of the
position in which I found myself ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. What sort of a position? You
hadn't any privations to put up with, had you? From that point of view your
husband, to give him his due, behaved really very well. You weren't forced to
earn your own living. And even if they gave you a hundred florins for a
poem&#8212;they certainly wouldn't give more&#8212;you weren't obliged to write a book like
that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Clement, dear, I didn't mean
the word &quot;position&quot; in a material sense; I meant the position in which my soul
was. Haven't you any conception ...? When you first met me, it was much
better&#8212;to a certain extent I had found myself; but at first ...! I was so
helpless and distracted. I did everything I could&#8212;I painted, I even gave English
lessons in the boardinghouse where I was living. Just think what it was like, to
be there as a divorced woman at twenty-two, to have no one ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Why didn't you stay quietly in
Vienna?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Because I was not on good
terms with my family. No one has really understood me. Oh, these people ...! Do
you suppose any of my relations could conceive that one should want anything
else from life except a husband and pretty clothes and a position in society!
Oh, good heavens ...! If I had had a child, things might have been very
different&#8212;and again they might not. I am a very complex creature. But after all,
what have you to complain of! Wasn't my going to Munich the best thing I could
have done? How else should I ever have known you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. That's all right&#8212;but you
didn't go there with that purpose in view.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I went because I wanted to be
free&#8212;inwardly free. I wanted to see if I could make the thing go on my own
resources. And you must admit that it looked as if I should be able to. I was on
the road to becoming famous. (<span class="sc">Clement</span> looks at her
dubiously.) But I cared more for you than even for fame.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span> (good-naturedly). And I'm a bit
more dependable.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I wasn't thinking about that.
I loved you from the very first moment&#8212;that was the thing that counted. I had
always dreamed of some one just like you; I had always known that no other sort
of man could make me happy. Blood isn't a mere empty word; it's the only thing
that counts. Do you know, that's why I always have a kind of idea ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. What?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. At least now and then the
thought comes to me that there may be some noble blood in my veins too.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. How so?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Well, it would be a
possibility.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I don't understand.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I told you that there used to
be aristocratic visitors at my parents' house ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Well, and if there were ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Who knows ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh, I say, Margaret! How can
you talk of such things!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, when you're about one can
never say what one thinks! That's the only thing the matter with you&#8212;if it
weren't for that you'd be perfect. (She nestles up to him.) I do love you so
tremendously. The very first evening, when you came into the café with
Wangenheim, I knew it at once&#8212;knew that you were the man for me. You know you
strode in among those people like a being from another world.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I hope so. And you, thank
goodness, didn't look as if you belonged to that one. No ... when I remember
that crowd&#8212;the Russian girl, for example, who looked like a student with her
close-cropped hair, only that she didn't wear the cap ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. She's a very talented artist,
the Baranzewich.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I know&#8212;you showed her to me in
the Pinakothek, standing on a ladder, copying pictures. And then the fellow with
the Polish name ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (begins to recall the name).
Zrkd ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh, don't bother&#8212;you won't
need to pronounce it any more. Once he delivered a lecture in the café, when I
was there, without seeming in the least embarrassed.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. He's a great genius&#8212;you may
take my word for it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh, of course&#8212;they're all
great geniuses at the café. And then there was that insufferable cub ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Who?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh, you know the fellow I
mean&#8212;the one that was always making tactless remarks about the aristocracy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Gilbert&#8212;you must mean
Gilbert.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. That's the one. Of course I
don't undertake to defend everybody in my station of life; there are clowns and
boobies in every rank, even among poets, I've been told. But it's unmannerly of
the fellow, one of us being there ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, that was his way.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I had to take myself sharply
in hand, or I should have said something rude. </p>

<p class="center"><a name="pix_340" href="#pixRef_340"><img src="images/pg340.png" alt="Gerhart Hauptmann"></a></p>
<p class="center">GERHART HAUPTMANN</p>

<p class="center"><i>Permission Albert Langen, Munich</i><br>
FROM OLAF GULBRANSSON'S &quot;FAMOUS CONTEMPORARIES&quot;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. He was an interesting man for
all that ... yes. And besides&#8212;he was fearfully jealous of you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. So I thought I noticed.
(Pause.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, they were all jealous of
you. Naturally ... you were so different. And then they all paid court to me,
just because they were all quite indifferent to me. You must have noticed that,
too, didn't you? What are you laughing at?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. It's comical ... If any one
had prophesied to me that I should marry one of the crowd at the Café
Maximilian! The ones I liked best were the two young painters&#8212;they were really
just as if they'd stepped out of a farce at the theatre. You know, those two
that looked so much alike, and shared everything together&#8212;I fancy even the
Russian girl on the step-ladder.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I never troubled my head
about such things.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Those two must have been Jews,
weren't they?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What makes you think so?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh ... because they were
always cutting jokes&#8212;and then their pronunciation ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I think you might dispense
with anti-Semitic remarks.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Come, child, don't be so
sensitive. I know you're half-Jewish. And really, you know, I've nothing against
the Jews. I even had an instructor once, who put me through my Greek for my
final exam. He was a Jew, if you like&#8212;and a splendid fellow. One meets all kinds
of people ... And I'm not sorry to have had a chance to see your Munich
circle&#8212;it's all a bit of experience.&#8212;But, you admit, I must have appeared to you
as a kind of life-saver.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes, indeed you did. Oh,
Clement, Clement ...! (She embraces him.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. What are you laughing at?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, a thought struck me ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Well ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. &quot;So, drunk with bliss, I hang
upon thy neck ...&quot;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span> (annoyed). I don't know why you
always have to spoil a fellow's illusions!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Tell me honestly,
Clement&#8212;wouldn't you be proud if your girl&#8212;if your wife&#8212;were a great, famous
authoress?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I've told you already what I
think. You may call me narrow if you like, but I assure you that if you began
writing poems again, or, even more, having them printed, in which you gushed
about me or told the world all about our happiness, there'd be an end of the
marriage&#8212;I should be up and off.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. And you say that&#8212;you, a man
who has had a dozen notorious affairs!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Notorious or not, my dear, <i>
I</i> never told anybody about them; I never rushed into print when a girl hung,
drunk with bliss, about my neck, so that anybody could buy it for a gulden and a
half. That's the thing, you see. I know that there are people who get their
living that way&#8212;but I don't consider it the thing to do. I tell you it seems
worse to me than for a girl to show herself off in tights as a Greek statue at
the Ronacher. At least she keeps her mouth shut&#8212;but the things that one of your
poets blabs out, well, they're past a joke!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (uneasily). Dearest, you
forget that a poet doesn't always tell the truth. We tell things which we
haven't experienced at all, but what we've dreamed, invented.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. My dear Margaret, I wish you
wouldn't always keep saying &quot;we.&quot; Thank heaven, you're out of that sort of thing
now!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Who knows?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (tenderly). Clem, I really
must tell you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Why, what's up now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Well, I'm not out of it&#8212;I
haven't given up writing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. You mean by that ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Just what I say&#8212;that I'm
still writing, or at least that I have written something. Yes, this impulse is
stronger than other people can conceive. I believe I should have gone to pieces
if I hadn't written.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Well, what have you been
writing this time?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. A novel. I had too much in my
breast that wanted to be said&#8212;I should have choked if I hadn't got it out. I
haven't said anything about it before&#8212;but of course I had to tell you sooner or
later. Künigel is delighted with it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Who is Künigel?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. My publisher.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Then somebody's read the thing
already?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes&#8212;and many more will read
it. Clement, you'll be proud&#8212;believe me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. You're mistaken, my dear
child. I think you have ... Well, what sort of things have you put into it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. That's not so easy to explain
in one word. The book contains, so to say, the best of what is to be said about
things.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Brava!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. And so I am able to promise
you that from this time on I shan't touch a pen. There's no more need.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Margaret, do you love me or
not?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. How can you ask? I love you,
and you alone. Much as I have seen, much as I have observed, I have felt
nothing&#8212;I waited for you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Then bring it here, your
novel.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Bring it here? How do you
mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. That you felt you had to write
it&#8212;may be; but at least no one shall read it. Bring it here&#8212;we'll throw it in
the fire.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Clement ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I ask that much of you&#8212;I have
a right to ask it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, it isn't possible! It's
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Not possible! When I wish
it&#8212;when I explain that I make everything else dependent on it ... you understand
me ... it may perhaps turn out to be possible.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. But, Clement, it's already
printed.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. What&#8212;printed?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes ... in a few days it'll
be for sale everywhere.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Margaret ...! And all this
without a word to me ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I couldn't help it, Clement.
When you see it, you'll forgive me&#8212;more than that, you'll be proud of me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. My dear girl, this is past a
joke.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Clement ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Good-by, Margaret.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Clement ...! What does this
mean? You are going?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. As you see.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. When will you be back?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. That I can't at the present
moment say. Good-by.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Clement ...! (Tries to
restrain him.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. If you please ... [Exit.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (alone). Clement ...! What
does this mean! He's leaving me? Oh, what shall I do?&#8212;Clement!&#8212;Can he mean that
all is over ...? No&#8212;it's impossible! Clement! I must follow him ... (Looks about
for her hat. The bell rings.) Ah ...he's coming back! He was only trying to
frighten me ... Oh, my Clement! (Goes toward door. Enter <span class="sc">
Gilbert</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> (to maid, who has opened door
for him). I told you I was sure she was at home. Good morning, Margaret.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (taken aback). You ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Yes, I&#8212;Amandus Gilbert.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I ... I'm so surprised ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. That is evident. But there's
no reason why you should be. I am only passing through&#8212;I'm on my way to Italy.
And really I've come to see you just for the purpose of bringing you a copy of
my latest work in remembrance of our old friendship. (Hands her the book. As she
does not take it at once, he lays it on the table.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You're very kind ... thank
you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh, not at all. You have a
certain right to this book. So this is where you live ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes. But ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh, it's only temporary, I
know. For furnished rooms they aren't bad. To be sure, these family portraits on
the walls would drive me to distraction.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. My landlady is the widow of a
general.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh, you needn't apologize.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Apologize ...? I wasn't
thinking of it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. It's very queer, when one
comes to think ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. To think of what?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Why shouldn't I say it? Of the
little room in the Steinsdorfer Strasse, with the balcony looking out on the
Isar. Do you remember it, Margaret?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Do you think you'd better
call me Margaret ... now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. As you please ... (Pause.
Suddenly.) You know really you behaved very badly ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Or do you prefer that I should
speak in paraphrases? Unfortunately I can't find any other expression for your
conduct. And it was all so unnecessary&#8212;it would have been just as well to be
honest with me. There was nothing to be gained by stealing away from Munich in
the dead of night.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. It wasn't the dead of night&#8212;I
left Munich by the express at 8.30 A. M., in bright sunshine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Well, anyhow, you might just
as well have said good-by, mightn't you? (Sits.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. The Baron may come in at any
moment.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Well, what if he does? You
surely haven't told him that once upon a time you lay in my arms and adored me.
I am just an old acquaintance from Munich&#8212;and as such I have surely the right to
call on you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Any other old
acquaintance&#8212;not you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Why? You persist in
misunderstanding me. I am really here only as an old acquaintance. Everything
else is over&#8212;long ago over ... Well, you'll see there. (Points to his book.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What book is that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. My latest novel.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, you're writing novels?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. To be sure.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Since when have you risen to
that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, I remember that your real
field was the small sketch, the observation of trivial daily occurrences ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> (excitedly). My field ...? My
field is the world! I write what I choose to write&#8212;I don't allow any bounds to
be set to my genius. I don't know what should prevent me from writing a novel.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Well, the standard critics
used to say ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. What standard critic do you
mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I remember, for example, a
feuilleton of Neumann's in the
<i>Allgemeine</i> ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> (angrily). Neumann is an idiot!
I've given him a blow in the face.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You've given him ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh, not literally ...
Margaret, you used to be as disgusted with him as I was&#8212;we agreed entirely in
the view that Neumann was an idiot. &quot;How can that mere cipher dare ...&quot;&#8212;those
were your very words, Margaret, &quot;How can he dare to set limits to you&#8212;to
strangle your next book before its birth?&quot; That's what you said! And now you
appeal to that charlatan!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Please don't shout so. My
landlady ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. I can't bother with thinking
about generals' widows when ray nerves are on edge.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>, But what did I say? I really
can't understand your being so sensitive.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Sensitive? You call it being
sensitive? You, who used to quiver from head to foot if the merest scribbler in
the most obscure rag ventured to say a word of criticism!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I don't remember that ever
any disparaging words have been written about me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh ...? Well, you may be
right. People are usually gallant to a pretty woman.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Gallant ...? So they used to
praise my poems only out of gallantry? And your own verdict ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Mine ...? I needn't take back
anything that I said&#8212;I may confine myself to remarking that your few really
beautiful poems were written in <i>our</i> time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. And so you think the credit
of them is really yours?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Would you have written them if
I had never existed? Weren't they written to <i>me</i>?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. No.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. What? Not written to me? Oh,
that's monstrous!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. No, they were not written to
you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. You take my breath away! Shall
I remind you of the situations in which your finest verses had their origin?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. They were addressed to an
ideal ... (<span class="sc">Gilbert</span> points to himself.) ... whose earthly
representative you happened to be.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Ha! That's fine! Where did you
get it? Do you know what the French say in such circumstances? &quot;That is
literature!&quot;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (imitating his tone). &quot;That is <i>
not</i> literature!&quot; That is the truth&#8212;the absolute truth. Or do you really
believe that I meant you by the slender youth&#8212;that I sang hymns of praise to
your locks? Even in those days you were ... well, not slender; and I shouldn't
call this locks. (Passes her hand over his hair. Taking the opportunity, he
seizes her hand and kisses it. In a softer voice.) What are you thinking of?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. You thought so in those
days&#8212;or at least that was your name for it. Ah, what won't poets say for the
sake of a smooth verse, a sounding rhyme? Didn't I call you once, in a sonnet,
&quot;my wise maiden?&quot; And all the time you were neither ... No, I mustn't be unjust
to you&#8212;you <i>were</i> wise, confoundedly wise, revoltingly wise! And it has
paid you. But one oughtn't to be surprised; you were always a snob at heart.
Well, now you've got what you wanted. You caught your prey, your blue-blooded
youth with the well-kept hands and the neglected brain, the splendid rider,
fencer, shot, tennis-player, heart-breaker&#8212;Marlitt couldn't have invented
anything more disgusting. What more do you want? Whether it will always content
you, that knew something higher once, is of course another question. I can only
say this one thing to you&#8212;in my eyes you are a renegade from love.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You thought that up in the
train.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. I thought it up just now&#8212;just
a moment ago!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Write it down, then&#8212;it's
good.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. What was it that attracted you
to a man of this sort? Nothing but the old instinct, the common instinct!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I don't think <i>you've</i>
got any right ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. My dear child, in the old days
I had a soul too to offer you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, at times, only this ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Don't try now to depreciate
our relation&#8212;you won't succeed. It will remain always your most splendid
experience.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Bah ... when I think that I
tolerated that rubbish for a whole year!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Tolerated? You were entranced
with it. Don't be ungrateful&#8212;I'm not. Miserably as you behaved at the last, for
me it can't poison my memories. And anyhow, that was part of the whole.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You don't mean it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Yes ... And now listen to this
one statement I owe to you: at the very time when you were beginning to turn
away from me, when you felt this drawing toward the stable&#8212;<i>la nostalgie de
l'écurie</i>&#8212;I was realizing that at heart I was done with you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. No ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. It's quite characteristic,
Margaret, that you hadn't the least perception of it. Yes, I was done with you.
I simply didn't need you any more. What you could give me, you had given me; you
had fulfilled your function. You knew in the depths of your heart, you knew
unconsciously ... that your day was over. Our relation had achieved its purpose;
I do not regret having loved you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. <i>I</i> do!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. That's splendid! In that one
small observation lies, for the connoisseur, the whole deep distinction between
the true artist and the dilettante. To you, Margaret, our relation is today
nothing more than the recollection of a few mad nights, a few deep talks of an
evening in the alleys of the English Garden; I have made of it a work of art.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. So have I.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. How so? What do you mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What you've succeeded in
doing, if you please, I've succeeded in doing too. I also have written a novel
in which our former relations play a part, in which our former love&#8212;or what we
called by that name&#8212;is preserved to eternity.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. If I were in your place, I
wouldn't say anything about eternity until the second edition was out.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Well, anyhow, it means
something different when <i>I</i> write a novel from what it does when you write
one.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Yes ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You see, you're a free
man&#8212;you haven't got to steal the hours in which you can be an artist; and you
don't risk your whole future.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh ... do you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I have! Half an hour ago
Clement left me because I owned up to him that I had written a novel.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Left you? For ever?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I don't know. It is possible.
He went away in anger. He is unaccountable&#8212;I can't tell beforehand what he will
decide about me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Ah ... so he forbids you to
write! He won't allow the girl he loves to make any use of her brains&#8212;oh, that's
splendid! That's the fine flower of the nation! Ah ... yes. And you&#8212;aren't you
ashamed to experience the same sensations in the arms of such an idiot that you
once ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I forbid you to talk like
that about him! You don't understand him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Ha ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You don't know why he objects
to my writing&#8212;it's only out of love. He feels that I live in a world which is
closed to him; he blushes to see me exposing the innermost secrets of my soul to
strangers. He wants me for himself, for himself alone. And that's why he rushed
off ... no, not rushed; Clement isn't the sort of person who rushes off ...</p>

<p class="center">PAUL HEYSE</p>


<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. An admirable bit of
observation. But at any rate he's gone. We needn't discuss the tempo of his
departure. And he's gone because he won't allow you to yield to your desire to
create.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, if he could only
understand that! I could be the best, the truest, the noblest wife in the world,
if the right man existed!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. You admit by that expression
that he isn't the right one.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I didn't say that!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. I want you to realize that he
is simply enslaving you, ruining you, seeking to crush your personality out of
sheer egoism. Oh, think of the Margaret you were in the old days! Think of the
freedom you had to develop your ego when you loved me! Think of the choice
spirits who were your associates then, of the disciples who gathered round me
and were your disciples too. Don't you sometimes long to be back again? Don't
you sometimes think of the little room with the balcony ... and the Isar flowing
beneath the window ... (He seizes her hands and draws near to her.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. O God ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. It can all be so again&#8212;it
needn't be the Isar. I'll tell you what to do, Margaret. If he comes back, tell
him that you have some important business to see to in Munich, and spend the
time with me. Oh, Margaret, you're so lovely! We'll be happy once again,
Margaret, as we used to be. You remember, don't you? (Very close to her.) &quot;So,
drunk with bliss, I hang upon thy neck ...&quot;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (retreats quickly from him).
Go&#8212;go! No... no ... go, I tell you! You know I don't love you any more.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh, ... h'm ... Really? Well,
then I can only beg your pardon. (Pause.) Good-by, Margaret ... good-by.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Good-by.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Good-by ... (Turns back once
more.) Won't you at least, as a parting gift, let me have a copy of your novel?
I gave you mine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. It isn't out yet&#8212;it won't be
till next week.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. If you don't mind telling me
... what sort of a story is it?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. It is the story of my life&#8212;of
course disguised, so that no one can recognize me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh ...? How did you manage
that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. It was quite simple. The
heroine, to begin with, is not a writer but a painter ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Very clever of you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Her first husband was not a
cotton-manufacturer but a great speculator&#8212;and she deceived him not with a tenor
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Aha!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What are you laughing at?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. So you deceived him with a
tenor? That's something I didn't know.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. How do you know I did?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Why, you've just informed me
yourself.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I ...? How? I said the
heroine of my novel betrays her husband with a baritone.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. A basso would have been
grander&#8212;a mezzo-soprano more piquant.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Then she goes not to Munich
but to Dresden, and there has a relation with a sculptor.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Myself, I suppose ...
disguised?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Oh, very much disguised. The
sculptor is young, handsome, and a genius. In spite of all that, she leaves him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. For ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Guess!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Presumably a jockey.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Silly!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. A count, then? A prince?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. No&#8212;an archduke!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> (with a bow). Ah, you've spared
no expense.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes&#8212;an archduke, who abandons
his position at court for her sake, marries her, and goes away with her to the
Canary Islands.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. The Canary Islands! That's
fine. And then ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. With their landing in ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. ... the Canaries ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. ... the novel ends.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh, I see ... I'm very
curious&#8212;especially about the disguise.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Even you would not be able to
recognize me, if it were not ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Well ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. If it were not that in the
last chapter but two I've reproduced all our correspondence!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. What?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes&#8212;all the letters you wrote
me, and all those I wrote you are included.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Excuse me ... but how did you
get yours to me? I've got them all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Ah, but I kept the rough
drafts of them all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Rough drafts?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Rough drafts ...! Of those
letters to me that seemed to be dashed off in quivering haste? &quot;Just one word
more, dearest, before I sleep&#8212;my eyes are closing already ...&quot; and then, when
your eyes had quite closed, you wrote me off a fair copy?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Well, have you anything to
complain of?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. I might have suspected it. I
suppose I ought to congratulate myself that they weren't borrowed from a Lover's
Manual. Oh, how everything crumbles around me ... the whole past is in ruins!
She kept rough drafts of her letters!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You ought to be glad. Who
knows whether my letters to you will not be the only thing people will remember
about you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. But it's an extremely awkward
situation for another reason ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What is that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> (points to his book). You see,
they're all in there too.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What? Where?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. In my novel.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What's in your novel?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Our letters ... yours and
mine.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. How did you get yours, then,
since I have them? Ah, you see you wrote rough drafts too!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh no&#8212;I only made copies of
them before I sent them to you. I didn't want them to be lost. There are some in
the book that you never got; they were too good for you&#8212;you'd never have
understood them.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. For heaven's sake, is that
true? (Quickly turns over the leaves of <span class="sc">Gilbert's</span> book.)
Yes, it is! Oh, it's just as if we told the whole world that we had ... Oh, good
gracious ...! (Excitedly turning over the leaves.) You don't mean to tell me you
put in the one I wrote you the morning after the first night ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Of course I did&#8212;it was really
brilliant.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. But that's too dreadful!
It'll be a European scandal. And Clement ... heavens! I'm beginning to wish that
he may not come back. I'm lost&#8212;and you with me! Wherever you go, he'll know how
to find you&#8212;he'll shoot you down like a mad dog!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> (puts his book in his pocket).
A comparison in very poor taste.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. How came you by that insane
idea? The letters of a woman whom you professed to love ...! It's easy to see
that you are no gentleman.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh, that's too amusing! Didn't
you do exactly the same thing?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I am a woman.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. You remember it now!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. It is true&#8212;I have nothing to
boast of over you. We are worthy of each other. Yes ... Clement was right; we
are worse than the women at the Ronacher who exhibit themselves in tights. Our
most hidden bliss, our sorrows, all ... given to the world ... Bah! I loathe
myself! Yes, we two belong together&#8212;Clement would be quite right to drive me
from him. (Suddenly.) Come, Amandus!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. What are you going to do?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I accept your proposal.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Proposal? What proposal?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. I'll fly with you! (Looks
about for her hat and cloak.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. What are you thinking of?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (very much excited, puts her
hat on with decision). It may all be as it was before&#8212;so you said just now. It
needn't be the Isar ... Well, I'm ready.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. But this is perfectly crazy!
Fly with me ...? What would be the use of that? Didn't you say yourself that he
would know how to find me wherever I went? If you were with me, he would find
you too. It would be a great deal more sensible for each of us alone ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. You wretch! Would you abandon
me now? And a few minutes ago you were on your knees to me! Have you no shame?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. What is there to be ashamed
of? I am an ailing, nervous man ... I am subject to moods ... (<span class="sc">Margaret</span>,
at window, utters a loud cry.) What's the matter? What will the general's widow
think of me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. There he is! He's coming!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. In that case ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What&#8212;you're going?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. I didn't come hero with the
intention of calling on the Baron.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. He'll meet you on the
stairs&#8212;that would be worse still! Stay where you are&#8212;I refuse to be the only
victim.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Don't be a fool! Why are you
trembling so? He can't have read both novels. Control yourself&#8212;take off your
hat. Put your cloak away. (Helps her to take her things off.) If he finds you in
this state, he'll be bound to suspect ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. It's all one to me&#8212;as well
now as later. I can't endure to wait for the horror&#8212;I'll tell him everything at
once.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Everything?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes, as long as you're here.
If I come out honestly and confess everything, he may forgive me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. And what about me? I have
better things to do in the world than to allow myself to be shot down like a mad
dog by a jealous baron! (Bell rings.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. There he is&#8212;there he is!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. You won't say anything!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Yes, I mean to speak out.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh, you will, will you? Have a
care, then! I'll sell my skin dearly.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. What will you do?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. I'll hurl such truths into his
very face as no baron ever heard before. (Enter CLEMENT; rather surprised at
finding him, very cool and polite.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh ... Herr Gilbert, if I'm
not mistaken?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Yes, Baron. Happening to pass
this way on a journey to the south, I could not refrain from coming to pay my
respects ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Ah, I see ... (Pause.) I'm
afraid I have interrupted a conversation&#8212;I should be sorry to do that. Please
don't let me be in the way.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> (to <span class="sc">Margaret</span>).
Ah ... what <i>were</i> we talking about?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Perhaps I may be able to
assist your memory. In Munich you always used to be talking about your books ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Ah ... precisely. As a matter
of fact, I <i>was</i> speaking of my new novel ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh ... then please go on. It's
quite possible to discuss literature with me&#8212;isn't it, Margaret? What is your
novel? Naturalist! Symbolist? A chapter of experience?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Oh, in a certain sense we all
write but of things we have lived.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. That's very interesting.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Even when one writes a Nero,
it's absolutely indispensable that at least in his heart he shall have set fire
to Rome ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Of course.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Where else is one to get
inspiration except from oneself? Where is one to find models except in the life
around one? (<span class="sc">Margaret</span> is growing more and more uneasy.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. The trouble is that the
model's consent is so seldom asked. I'm bound to say, if I were a woman, I
shouldn't thank a man for telling the world ... (Sharply.) In decent society we
call that ... compromising a woman.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. I don't know whether I may
include myself in &quot;decent society&quot;&#8212;but I call that doing honor to a woman.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. The essential thing is to hit
the mark. What, in the higher sense, does it matter whether a woman has been
happy in one man's arms or another's?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Herr Gilbert, I will call your
attention to the fact that you are speaking in the presence of a lady!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. I am speaking in the presence
of an old comrade who may be supposed to share my views on these matters.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (suddenly). Clement ...!
(Throws herself at his feet.) Clement ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span> (taken aback). Really ...
really, Margaret!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. Forgive me, Clement!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. But&#8212;Margaret ...! (To <span class="sc">
Gilbert</span>. ) It is extremely unpleasant for me, Herr Gilbert ... Get up,
Margaret&#8212;get up! It's all right. (<span class="sc">Margaret</span> looks up at
him inquiringly.) Yes&#8212;get up! (She rises.) It's all right&#8212;it's all settled. You
may believe me when I tell you. All you've got to do is to telephone a single
word to Künigel. I've arranged everything with him. We'll call it in&#8212;you agree
to that?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. What are you going to call in,
may I ask? Her novel?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Oh, you know about it? It
would seem, Herr Gilbert, that the comradeship you speak of has been brought
pretty well up to date.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Yes ... There is really
nothing for me to do but to ask your pardon. I am really in a very embarrassing
position ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. I regret very much, Herr
Gilbert, that you have been forced to be a spectator of a scene which I may
almost describe as domestic ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span>. Ah ... well, I do not wish to
intrude any further&#8212;I will wish you good day. May I, as a tangible token that
all misunderstanding between us has been cleared up, as a feeble evidence of my
good wishes, present you, Baron, with a copy of my latest novel?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. You are very kind, Herr
Gilbert. I must own, to be sure, that German novels are not my pet weakness.
Well, this is probably the last I shall read&#8212;or the next to the last ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>, <span class="sc">Gilbert</span>.
The next to the last ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. And the last to be ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. Yours, my dear. (Takes a book
from his pocket.) You see, I begged Künigel for a single copy, in order to
present it to you&#8212;or rather to both of us. (<span class="sc">Margaret</span> and <span class="sc">
Gilbert</span> exchange distracted glances.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. How good you are! (Takes the
book from him.) Yes ... that's it!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span>. We'll read it together.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span>. No, Clement ... no ... I
can't let you be so good! There ...! (Throws the book into the fire.) I don't
want to hear any more of all that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> (delighted). Oh, but ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Clement</span> (goes toward the chimney).
Margaret ...! What are you doing?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Margaret</span> (stands in front of fire,
throws her arms round CLEMENT).
<i>Now</i> will you believe that I love you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> (much relieved). I think I am
rather in the way ... Good-by ... good day, Baron ... (Aside.) To think that I
should have to miss a climax like that ...! [Exit.]</p>

<h2>THE COURT SINGER (1900)</h2>

<h3>TRANSLATED BY ALBERT WILHELM BOESCHE, PH.D.<br>
Assistant Professor of German, Cornell University</h3>

<h2><span class="sc">SCENERY</span></h2>


<p class="hang1">Pretentiously furnished room in a hotel. Entrance from the
corridor in the centre; also side doors. In front to the right a window with
heavy closed curtains. To the left a grand piano. Behind the piano a Japanese
screen covering the fireplace. Big open trunks are standing around. Enormous
laurel wreaths on several upholstered armchairs. A mass of bouquets are
distributed about the room, some of them being piled up on the piano.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE I</h2>

<p class="center">Valet de chambre. Immediately afterward an elevator boy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span> (enters with an armful of clothes
from the adjoining room, puts them into one of the big trunks. Knocks on the
door; he straightens up). Well?&#8212;Come in!</p>

<p class="center">[Enter an elevator boy.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Boy</span>. There's a woman downstairs wants
to know if Mr. Gerardo is in.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. No, he isn't in. (Exit elevator
boy. Valet goes into the adjoining room, returns with another armful of clothes.
Knock on the door. He lays the clothes aside and walks to the door.) Well, who's
this now? (Opens the door, receives three or four large bouquets, comes forward
with them and lays them carefully on the piano, then resumes packing. Another
knock, he goes to the door, opens it, receives a batch of letters in all
varieties of colors, comes forward and examines the addresses.) &quot;Mr.
Gerardo.&quot;&#8212;&quot;Courtsinger Gerardo.&quot;&#8212;&quot;Monsieur Gerardo.&quot;&#8212;&quot;Gerardo Esq.&quot;&#8212;&quot;To the Most
Honorable Courtsinger Gerardo&quot;&#8212;that's from the chambermaid, sure!&#8212;&quot;Mr. Gerardo,
Imperial and royal Courtsinger.&quot; (Puts the letters on a tray, then continues
packing.)</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE II</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span>, valet, later the elevator
Boy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> What, aren't you through with
packing yet?&#8212;How long does it take you to pack?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. I'll be through in a minute,
Sir.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Be quick about it. I have some
work left to do before I go. Come, let me have a look at things. (He reaches
into one of the trunks.) Great Heavens, man! Don't you know how to fold a pair
of trousers? (Takes out the garment in question.) Do you call that packing? Well
I <i>do</i> believe, I might teach you a thing or two, though, surely, you ought
to be better at this than I! Look here, that's the way to take hold of a pair of
trousers. Then hook them here. Next, turn to these two buttons. Watch closely
now, it all depends on these two buttons; and then&#8212;pull&#8212;the trousers straight.
There you are! Now finish up by folding them once&#8212;like this. That's the way.
They won't lose their shape now in a hundred years!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span> (quite reverent, with eyes cast
down). Perhaps Mr. Gerardo used to be a tailor once.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> What? A tailor, I? Not quite.
Simpleton! (Handing the trousers to him.) There, put them back, but be quick
about it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span> (bending down over the trunk).
There's another batch of letters for you, Sir.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (walking over to the left).
Yes, I've seen them.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. And flowers!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Yes, yes. (Takes the letters
from the tray and throws himself into an armchair in front of the piano.) Now,
for pity's sake, hurry up and get through. Valet disappears in adjoining room.
Gerardo opens the letters, glances through them with a radiant smile, crumples
them up and throws them under his chair. From one of them he reads as follows:)
&quot;... To belong to you who to me are a god! To make me infinitely happy for the
rest of my life, how little that would cost you! Consider, please, ...&quot; (To
himself.) Great Heavens! Here I am to sing Tristan in Brussels tomorrow night
and don't remember a single note!&#8212;Not a single note! (Looking at his watch.)
Half-past three.&#8212;Forty-five minutes left. (A knock.) Come i&#8212;n!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Boy</span> (lugging in a basket of champagne).
I was told to put this in Mr....</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> <i>Who</i> told you?&#8212;Who is
downstairs?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Boy</span>. I was told to put this in Mr.
Gerardo's room.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (rising). What is it? (Relieves
him of the basket.) Thank you. (Exit elevator boy. <span class="sc">Gerardo</span>
lugs basket forward.) For mercy's sake! Now what am I to do with this! (Reads
the name on the giver's card and calls out.) George!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span> (enters from the adjoining room
with another armful of clothes). It's the last lot. Sir. (Distributes them among
the various trunks which he then closes.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Very well.&#8212;I am at home to no
one!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. I know. Sir.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> To no one, I say!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. You may depend on me, Sir.
(Handing him the trunk keys.) Here are the keys, Mr. Gerardo.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (putting the keys in his
pocket). To <i>no one!</i></p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. The trunks will be taken down at
once. (Starts to leave the room.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Wait a moment ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span> (returning). Yes, Sir?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (gives him a tip). What I said
was: to <i>no one!</i></p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. Thank you very much indeed. Sir.
[Exit.]</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE III</h2>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (alone, looking at his watch).
Half an hour left. (Picks out the piano arrangement of &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; from
under the flowers on the piano and, walking up and down, sings mezza voce:)</p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">&quot;Isolde! Beloved! Art thou mine?<br>
 Once more my own? May I embrace thee?&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em">(Clears his throat, strikes two thirds on the piano
and begins anew:)</p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">&quot;Isolde! Beloved! Art thou mine?<br>
 Once more my own? ...&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em">(Clears his throat.) The air is simply infernal in
here! (Sings:)</p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">&quot;Isolde! Beloved! ...&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em">I feel as if there were a leaden weight on me! I must
have a breath of fresh air, quick! (Goes to the window and tries to find the
cord by which to draw the curtain aside.) Where can that thing be?&#8212;On the other
side. There! (Draws the curtain aside quickly and seeing <span class="sc">Miss
Coeurne</span> before him, throws back his head in a sort of mild despair.)
Goodness gracious!</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE IV</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. <span class="sc">Gerardo</span></p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (sixteen years old, short
skirts, loose-hanging light hair. Has a bouquet of red roses in her hand, speaks
with an English accent, looks at <span class="sc">Gerardo</span> with a full and
frank expression). Please, do not send me away.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> What else am I to do with you?
Heaven knows <i>I</i> did not ask you to come here. It would be wrong of you to
take it amiss but, you see, I have to sing tomorrow night. I must tell you
frankly. I thought I should have this half hour to myself. Only just now I've
given special and strictest orders not to admit anybody, no matter who it might
be.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (stepping forward). Do not
send me away. I heard you as Tannhäuser last night and came here merely to offer
you these roses.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Yes?&#8212;Well?&#8212;And&#8212;?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. And myself!&#8212;I hope I am
saying it right.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (grasps the back of a chair;
after a short struggle with himself he shakes his head). Who are you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. Miss Coeurne.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I see.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. I am still quite a simple
girl.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I know. But come here, Miss
Coeurne. (Sits down in an armchair and draws her up in front of him.) Let me
have a serious talk with you, such as you have never heard before in your young
life but seem to need very much at the present time. Do you think because I am
an artist&#8212;now don't misunderstand me, please. You are&#8212;how old are you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. Twenty-two.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> You are sixteen, at most
seventeen. You make yourself several years older in order to appear more
attractive to me. Well now? You are still quite simple, to be sure. But, as I
was going to say, my being an artist certainly does not impose upon me the duty
to help you to get over being simple! Don't take it amiss. Well? Why are you
looking away now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. I told you I was still
very simple because that's the way they like to have young girls here in
Germany.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I am not a German, my child,
but at the same time ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. Well?&#8212;I am not so simple,
after all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I am no children's nurse
either! That's not the right word, I feel it, for&#8212;you are no longer a child,
unfortunately?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. No!&#8212;Unfortunately!&#8212;Not
now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> But you see, my dear young
woman&#8212;you have your games of tennis, you have your skating club, you may go
bicycling or take mountain trips with your lady friends. You may enjoy yourself
swimming or riding on horseback or dancing whichever you like. I am sure you
have everything a young girl could wish for. Then why do you come to me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. Because I hate all of
that and because it's such a bore!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> You are right; I won't dispute
what you say. Indeed, you embarrass me. I myself, I must frankly confess, see
something else in life. But, my child, I am a man and I am thirty-six years old.
The time will come when you may likewise lay claim to a deeper and fuller life.
Get two years older and, I am sure, the right one will turn up for you. Then it
will not be necessary for you to come unasked to me, that is to say to one whom
you do not know any more intimately than&#8212;all Europe knows him&#8212;and to conceal
yourself behind the window curtains in order to get a taste of the higher life.
(Pause. <span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> breathes heavily.) Well?&#8212;Let me
thank you cordially and sincerely for your roses! (Presses her hand.) Will you
be satisfied with that for today?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. As old as I am, I never
yet gave a thought to a man until I saw you on the stage yesterday as
Tannhäuser.&#8212;And I will promise you ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Oh please, child, don't
promise me anything. How can a promise you might make at the present time be of
any value to me? The disadvantage of it would be entirely yours. You see, my
child, the most loving father could not speak more lovingly to you than I. Thank
a kind providence for not having been delivered into some other artist's hands
by your indiscretion. (Presses her hand.) Let it be a lesson to you for the rest
of your life and be satisfied with that.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (covering her face with
her handkerchief, in an undertone, without tears). Am I so ugly?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Ugly?&#8212;How does that make you
ugly?&#8212;You are young and indiscreet! (Rises nervously, walks over to the left,
returns, puts his arm around her and takes her hand.) Listen to me, my child! If
I have to sing, if I am an artist by profession, how does that make you ugly?
What an unreasonable inference: I am ugly, I am ugly. And yet it is the same
wherever I go. Think of it! When I've only a few minutes left to catch the
train, and tomorrow night it's Tristan ...! Do not misunderstand me, but surely,
my being a singer does not make it incumbent upon me to affirm the charm of your
youthfulness and beauty. Does that make you ugly, my child? Make your appeal to
other people who are not as hard-pressed as I am. Do you really think it would
ever occur to me to, say such a thing to you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. To say it? No. But to
think it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Now, Miss Coeurne, let us be
reasonable! Do not inquire into my thoughts about you. Really, at this moment
they do not concern us in the least. I assure you, and please take my word for
it as an artist, for I could not be more honest to you: I am unfortunately so
constituted that I simply cannot bear to see any creature whatsoever suffer, not
even the meanest. (Looking at her critically, but with dignity.) And for you, my
child, I am sincerely sorry; I may say that much, after you have so far fought
down your maidenly pride as to wait for me here. But please, Miss Coeurne, do
take into account the life I have to lead. Just think of the mere question of
time! At least two hundred, may be as many as three hundred charmingly
attractive young girls of your age saw me on the stage yesterday in the part of
Tannhäuser. Suppose now every one of these young girls expected as much of me as
you do. What in the world would become of my singing? What would become of my
voice? Just how could I keep up my profession? (She sinks into a chair, covers
her face and weeps; he sits down on the armrest beside her, bends over her,
sympathetically.) It's really sinful of you, my child, to shed tears over being
so young. Your whole life is still before you. Be patient. The thought of your
youth should make you happy. How glad the rest of us would be&#8212;even if one lives
the life of an artist like myself&#8212;to start over again from the very beginning.
Please be not ungrateful for hearing me yesterday. Spare me this disconcerting
sequel. Am I to blame for your falling in love with me? You are only one of
many. My manager insists on my assuming this august manner on the stage. You see
there's more to it than mere singing. I simply have to play the part of
Tannhäuser that way. Now be good, my child. I have only a few moments left. Let
me use them in preparing for tomorrow.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (rises, dries her tears),
I cannot imagine another girl acting like me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (man&#339;uvering her to the door).
Quite right, my child ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (gently resisting him,
sobbing). At least not&#8212;if ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> If my valet were not guarding
the door downstairs.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (as above). &#8212;if&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> If she is as pretty and
charmingly young as you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (as above). &#8212;if&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> If she has heard me just once
as Tannhäuser.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (sobbing again violently).
If she is as respectable as I!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (pointing to the grand piano).
Now, before you leave, take a look at those flowers. Let it be a warning to you,
if you should ever feel tempted again to fall in love with a singer. Do you see,
how fresh they are, all of them! I just let them fade and go to waste or give
them to the porter. Then look at these letters. (Takes a handful from the tray.)
I know none of the ladies who have written them; don't you worry. I leave them
to their fate. What else can I do? But, you may believe me, every one of your
charming young friends is among them.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (pleadingly). Well, I
won't hide myself a second time.&#8212;I won't do it again ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Really, my child, I haven't
any more time. It's too bad, but I am about to leave town. I told you, did I
not, that I am sorry for you? I really am, but my train is scheduled to leave in
twenty-five minutes. So what more do you want?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. A kiss.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (standing up stiff and
straight). From me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (putting his arm around her,
dignified, but sympathetic). You are desecrating art, my child. Do you really
think it's for this that they are willing to pay my weight in gold? Get older
first and learn to respect more highly the chaste goddess to whom I devote my
life and labor.&#8212;You don't know whom I mean?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. No.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> That's what I thought. Now, in
order not to be inhuman, I will present you with my picture. Will you give me
your word that after that you will leave me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Very well, then. (Walks back
of the table to sign one of his photographs.) Why don't you try to interest
yourself in the operas themselves rather than in the men on the stage? You may
find it to be a higher enjoyment, after all.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span> (in an undertone). I am
too young.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Sacrifice yourself to music!
(Comes forward and hands her the photograph.) You are too young, but&#8212;may be
you'll succeed in spite of that. Do not see in me the famous singer, but the
unworthy tool in the hands of a master. Look around among the married women you
know; all of them Wagnerians! Study his librettos, learn to feel each leitmotiv.
That will keep you from committing indiscretions.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Miss Coeurne</span>. I thank you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (escorts her out into the hall,
rings for the valet in passing through the door. Returns and picks up again the
piano arrangement of &quot;Tristan and Isolde;&quot; walks to the right). Come in!</p>

<br>

<h2>SCENE V</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> <span class="sc">Valet</span>. </p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span> (panting and breathless). Yes,
Sir? Your orders?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Are you standing at the door
downstairs?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. Not at present. Sir.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I can see as much&#8212;simpleton!
But you won't let anybody come up here, will you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. There were three ladies
inquiring about you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Don't you dare admit anybody,
whatever they tell you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. Then there's another batch of
letters.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Yes, never mind. (Valet puts
letter on tray.) Don't you dare admit anybody!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span> (at the door). Very well. Sir.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Not even, if they should offer
you an annuity for life.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span>. Very well, Sir. [Exit.]</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE VI</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span></p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (alone, tries to sing).
&quot;Isolde! Beloved! Art thou ...&quot; I should think these women might get tired of me <i>
some</i> time! But, then, the world holds so many of them! And I am only one.
Well, everybody bears his yoke and has to bear it! (Walks to the piano and
strikes two thirds.)</p>

<p class="center"><a name="pix_370" href="#pixRef_370"><img src="images/pg370.png" alt="Siegfried_Wagner"></a></p>
<p class="center">SIEGFRIED WAGNER</p>


<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE VII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> <span class="sc">Professor
Dühring</span>. Later a piano teacher.</p>

<p class="hang1">Professor Dühring, seventy years old, dressed in black, long,
white beard, his aquiline nose tinged with red, suggesting fondness for wine,
gold ringed spectacles, frock coat and silk hat, carries the score of an opera
under his arm, enters without knocking.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (turning around). What do you
want?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. Mr. Gerardo, I&#8212;I have ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> How did you get in here?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. I've been watching my chance
for two hours down on the sidewalk, Mr. Gerardo.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (recollecting). Let me see, you
are ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. For fully two hours I've been
standing down on the sidewalk. What else was I to do?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> But, my dear sir, I haven't
the time.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. I don't mean to play the whole
opera to you now.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I haven't the time left ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. You haven't the time left! How
about <i>me</i>! You are thirty. You have attained success in your art. You can
continue following your bent through the whole long life that still is before
you. I will ask you to listen only to your own part in my opera. You promised to
do so when you came to town.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> It's to no purpose, Sir. I am
not my own master ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. Please, Mr. Gerardo! Please,
please! Look at me, here's an old man lying before you on his knees who has
known only one thing in life: his art. I know what you would reply to me, you, a
young man who has been carried aloft on the wings of angels, one might say. &quot;If
you would have the goddess of Fortune find you, don't hunt for her.&quot; Do you
imagine, when one has cherished but a single hope for fifty years, one could
possibly have overlooked any means whatsoever within human reach, to attain that
hope? First one turns cynical and then serious again. tries to get there by
scheming, one is once more a light hearted child, and again an earnest seeker
after one's artistic ideals&#8212;not for ambition's sake, not for conviction's sake,
but simply because one cannot help it, because it's a curse which has been laid
on one by a cruel omnipotence to which the life-long agony of its creature is a
pleasing offering! A pleasing offering, I say, for we whom art enthralls rebel
against our lot as little as does the slave of a woman against his seductress,
as little as does the dog against his master who whips him.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (in despair). I am powerless
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. Let me tell you, my dear Sir,
the tyrants of antiquity who, as you know, would have their slaves tortured to
death just for a pleasant pastime, they were mere children, they were harmless
innocent little angels as compared with that divine providence which thought it
was creating those tyrants in its own image.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> While I quite comprehend you
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (while <span class="sc">Gerardo</span>
vainly tries several times to interrupt him; he follows <span class="sc">Gerardo</span>
through the room and repeatedly blocks his attempt to reach the door). You do
not comprehend me. You cannot comprehend me. How could you have had the time to
comprehend me! Fifty years of fruitless labor, Sir, that is more than you can
comprehend, if one has been a favorite child of fortune like you. But I'll try
to make you realize it approximately, at least. You see, I am too old to take my
own life. The proper time to do that is at twenty-five, and I have missed my
opportunity. I must live out my life now, my hand has grown too unsteady. But
would you know what an old man like me will do! You ask me how I got in here.
You have put your valet on guard at the hotel entrance. I did not try to slip by
him, I've known for fifty years what he will tell me: the gentleman is not in.
But with my score here I stood at the corner of the building for two hours in
the rain until he went up for a moment. Then I followed him, and while you were
speaking to him in here, I concealed myself on the staircase&#8212;I need not tell you
where. And then, when he had gone down again, I entered here. That's what a man
of my years will do to reach one who might be his grandson. Please, Sir, please,
let not this moment be without result for me even though it cost you a day, even
though it cost you a whole week. It will be to your advantage as well as mine. A
week ago, when you came to town on your starring tour, you promised me to let me
play my opera to you; and since that time I've called every day. You either were
rehearsing or had lady visitors. And now you are about to depart, which would
mean that an old man like me in vain spent a whole week standing around in the
street! And all it would cost you is a single word: &quot;I will sing your Hermann.&quot;
Then my opera will be performed. Then you will thank God for my intrusiveness,
for&#8212;you sing &quot;Siegfried,&quot; you sing &quot;Florestan&quot;&#8212;but you haven't in your repertory
a more grateful part, one more adapted to a singer of your resources than that
of &quot;Hermann.&quot; Then with loud acclaim they will draw me out of my obscurity, and
perhaps I'll have the opportunity of giving to the world at least a part of what
I might have given, if it had not cast me out like a leper. But the great
material gain resulting from my long struggle will not be mine, you alone will
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (having given up the attempt to
stop his visitor, leans on the mantle piece of the fireplace. While drumming on
the marble slab with his right hand, something behind the screen seems to excite
his curiosity. He investigates, then suddenly reaches out and draws a piano
teacher forward, dressed in gray. Holding her by the collar, with outstretched
arm, he thus leads her forward in front of the piano and out through the centre
door. Having locked the door, to <span class="sc">Dühring</span>). Please, don't
let this interrupt you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. You see, there are performed
ten new operas every year which become impossible after the second night, and
every ten years a good one which lives. Now this opera of mine <i>is</i> a good
one, it is well adapted for the stage, it is sure to be a financial success. If
you let me, I'll show you letters from Liszt, from Wagner, from Rubinstein, in
which these men look up to me as to a superior being. And why has it remained
unperformed to the present day? Because I don't stand in the public
market-place. I tell you, it's like what will happen to a young girl who for
three years has been the reigning beauty at all dancing parties, but has
forgotten to become engaged. One has to give way to another generation. Besides
you know our court theatres. They are fortresses, I can assure you, compared
with which the armor-plate of Metz and Rastadt is the merest tin. They would
rather dig out ten corpses than admit a single living composer. And it's in
getting over these ramparts that I ask you to lend me a hand. You are inside at
thirty, I am outside at seventy. It would cost you just a word to let me in,
while I am vainly battering my head against stone and steel. That's why I have
come to you (<i>very passionately</i>) and if you are not absolutely inhuman, if
your success has not killed off in you the very last trace of sympathy with
striving fellow-artists, you cannot refuse my request.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I will let you know a week
from now. I will play your opera through. Let me take it along.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. I am too old for that, Mr.
Gerardo. Long before a week, as measured by your chronology, has elapsed, I
shall lie beneath the sod. I've been put off that way too often. (Bringing down
his fist on the piano.) Hie Rhodus! Hie salta! It's five years ago now that I
called on the manager of the Royal Theatre, Count Zedlitz: &quot;What have you got
for me, my dearest professor?&quot; &quot;An opera, your Excellency.&quot; &quot;Indeed, you have
written a new opera? Splendid!&quot; &quot;Your Excellency, I have not written a new
opera. It's an old opera. I wrote it thirteen years ago.&quot;&#8212;It wasn't this one
here, it was my <i>Maria de Medicis</i>.&#8212;&quot;But why don't you let us have it then?
Why, we are just hunting for new works. We simply cannot shuffle through any
longer, turning the old ones over and over. My secretary is traveling from one
theatre to another, without finding anything, and you, who live right here,
withhold your production from us in proud disdain of the common crowd!&quot; &quot;Your
Excellency,&quot; I replied, &quot;I am not withholding anything from anybody. Heaven is
my witness. I submitted this opera to your predecessor, Count Tornow, thirteen
years ago and had to go to his office myself three years later to get it back.
Nobody had as much as looked at it.&quot; &quot;Now just leave it here, my dear professor.
A week from now at the latest you'll have our answer.&quot; And in saying this he
pulls the score from under my arm and claps it into the lowest drawer and that's
where it is lying today! That's where it is lying today, Sir! But what would I
do, child that I am in spite of my white hair, but go home and tell my Gretchen:
they need a new opera here at our theatre. Mine is practically accepted now! A
year later death took her away from me,&#8212;and she was the one friend left who had
been with me when I began to work on it. (Sobs and dries his tears.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Sir, I cannot but feel the
deepest sympathy for you ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. That's where it is lying
today.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> May be you actually are a
child in spite of your white hair. I must confess I doubt if I can help you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (in violent rage). So you can
endure the sight of an old man dragging himself along beside you on the same
path on which your victorious flight carries you to the sun! Who knows but
tomorrow you will lie on your knees before me and boast of knowing me, and today
you see in the agonized groan of a creative artist nothing but a sad mistake and
you cannot wring from your greed of gold the half hour it would take to rid me
of the chains that are crushing me.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Sit down and play, sir! Come!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (sits down at the piano, opens
his score, and strikes two chords). No, that's not the way it reads. I have to
get back into it first. (Strikes three chords, then turns several leaves.) That
is the overture; I won't detain you with it.&#8212;Now here comes the first scene ...
(Strikes two chords.) Here you stand at the deathbed of your father. Just a
moment until I get my bearings ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Perhaps all you say is quite
true. But at any rate you misjudge my position.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (plays a confused orchestration
and sings in a deep grating voice).</p>
<div style="margin-left:4em">
<p class="continue">Alas, now death has come to the castle<br>
           As it is raging in our huts.<br>
           It moweth down both great and small ...</p>
</div>
<p class="hang1">(Interrupting himself.) No, that's the chorus. I had thought of
playing it to you because it's very good. Now comes your turn. (Resumes the
accompaniment and sings hoarsely:)</p>
<div style="margin-left:4em">
<p class="continue">           My life unto this fateful hour<br>
           Was dim and gray like the breaking morn.<br>
           Tortured by demons, I roamed about.<br>
           My eye is tearless!<br>
           Oh let me kiss once more thy hoary hair!</p>
</div>
<p class="hang1">(Interrupting himself.) Well? (Since <span class="sc">Gerardo</span>
does not answer, with violent irritation.) These anæmic, threadbare, plodding,
would-be geniuses who are puffing themselves up today! Whose technique is so
sublime, it makes them sterile, impotent at twenty! Meistersingers, philistines,
that's what they are, whether they are starving or basking in the public favor.
Fellows that go to the cookbook rather than to nature to satisfy their hunger.
They think, indeed, they've learned her secret&#8212;naiveté! Ha&#8212;ha!&#8212;Tastes like
plated brass!&#8212;They make art their starting-point rather than life! Write music
for musicians rather than for yearning mankind! Blind, benighted ephemerons!
Senile youths whom the sun of Wagner has dried and shriveled up! (Seizing <span class="sc">
Gerardo's</span> arm violently.) To judge a man's creative genius, do you know
where I take hold of him first?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (stepping back). Well?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (putting his right hand around
his own left wrist and feeling his pulse). This is where I take hold of him
first of all. Do you see, right here! And if he hasn't anything here&#8212;please, let
me go on playing. (Turning more leaves.) I won't go through the whole monologue.
We shouldn't have the time anyway. Now here, scene three, end of the first act.
That's where the farm laborer's child, who had grown up with you in the castle,
suddenly enters. Now listen&#8212;after you have taken leave of your highly revered
mother. (Rapidly reading the text:) Demon, who art thou? May one enter? (To <span class="sc">
Gerardo.</span>) Those words are hers, you understand. (Continues reading.)
Barbette! Yes, it is I. Is your father dead? There he lies! (Plays and sings in
the highest falsetto.)</p>
<div style="margin-left:4em">
<p class="continue">           Full often did he stroke my curls.<br>
           Wherever he met me he was kind to me.<br>
           Alas, this is death.<br>
           His eyes are closed ...</p>
</div>
<p class="hang1">(Interrupting himself, looking at <span class="sc">Gerardo</span>
with self-assurance.) Now isn't that music?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Possibly.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (striking two chords). Isn't
that something more than the
<i>Trumpeter of Säkkingen</i>?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span>, Your confidence compels me to
be candid. I cannot imagine how I could use my influence with any benefit to
you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. In other words you mean to
tell me that it is antiquated music.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I would much rather call it
modern music.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. Or modern music. Pardon my
slip of the tongue, Mr. Gerardo. It's what will happen when one gets old. You
see, one manager will write me: We cannot use your opera, it is antiquated
music&#8212;and another writes: We cannot use it because it is modern music. In plain
language both mean the same: We don't want any opera of yours, because as a
composer <i>you don't count</i>.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I am a Wagner singer, Sir, I
am no critic. If you want to see your opera performed, you had better apply to
those who are paid for knowing what is good and what is bad. My judgment in such
matters, don't doubt that for a moment, Sir, counts the less, the more I am
recognized and esteemed as a singer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. My dear Mr. Gerardo, you may
rest assured, I don't believe in your judgment either. What do I care for your
judgment! I think I know what to expect of a tenor. I am playing this opera to
you to make you say: I'll sing your Hermann! I'll sing your Hermann!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> It won't avail you anything. I
must do what I am asked to do; I am bound by my contracts. You can afford to
stand down in the street for a week. A day more or less makes no difference to
you. But if <i>I</i> do not leave here by the next train, my prospects in this
world are ruined. May be, in another world they will engage singers who break
their contracts! My chains are drawn more tightly than the harness of a carriage
horse. If anybody, even an absolute stranger, asks me for material assistance
lie will find I have an open hand, although the sacrifice of happiness my
calling exacts of me is not paid for with five hundred thousand francs a year.
But if you ask of me the slightest assertion of personal liberty, you are
expecting too much of a slave such as I am. I <i>can not</i> sing your Hermann
as long as you don't count as a composer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. Please, Sir, let me continue.
It will give you a desire for the part.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> If you but knew, Sir, how
often I have a desire for things which I must deny myself and how often I must
assume burdens for which I have not the least desire! I have absolutely no
choice in the matter. You have been a free man all your life. How can you
complain of not being in the market? Why don't you go and put yourself in the
market?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. Oh, the haggling&#8212;the
shouting&#8212;the meanness you meet with! I have tried it a hundred times.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> One must do what one is
capable of doing and not what one is incapable of doing.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. Everything has to be learned
first.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> One must learn that which one
is capable of learning. How am I to know if the case is not very much the same
with your work as a composer.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. I <i>am</i> a composer, Mr.
Gerardo.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> You mean by that, you have
devoted your whole strength to the writing of operas.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. Quite so.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> And you hadn't any left to
bring about a performance.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. Quite so.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> The composers whom I know go
about it just the other way. They slap their operas on paper the best way they
know and keep their strength for bringing about a performance.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. They are a type of composer I
don't envy.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> They would reciprocate that
feeling, Sir. These people do count. One must be <i>something</i>. Name me a
single famous man who did not
<i>count</i>! If one is not a composer, one is something else, that's all, and
there's no need of being unhappy about it, either. I was something else myself
before I became a Wagner singer&#8212;something, my efficiency at which nobody could
doubt, and with which I was entirely satisfied. It is not for <i>us</i> to say
what we are intended for in this world. If it were, any Tom, Dick, or Harry
might come along! Do you know what I was before they discovered me? I was a
paperhanger's apprentice. Do you know what that is like! (Indicating by
gesture.) I put paper on walls&#8212;with paste. I don't conceal my humble origin from
anybody. Now just imagine, that as a paperhanger I should have taken it into my
head to become a Wagner singer! Do you know what they would have done to me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. They would have sent you to
the madhouse.</p>

FROM OLAF GULBRANSSON'S &quot;FAMOUS CONTEMPORARIES&quot;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Exactly, and rightly so.
Whoever is dissatisfied with what he is will not get anywhere as long as he
lives. A healthy man does that at which he is successful; if he fails, he
chooses another calling. You spoke of the judgment of your friends. It does not
take much to obtain expressions of approbation and admiration which do not cost
those anything who utter them. Since my fifteenth year I have been paid for
every labor I've performed and should have considered it a disgrace to be
compelled to do something for nothing. Fifty years of fruitless struggling! Can
anybody be so stubborn as not to have that convince him of the impossibility of
his dreams! What did you get out of your life? You have sinfully wasted it! I
have never striven for anything out of the ordinary; but, Sir, I can assure you
of one thing: that since my earliest childhood days I have never had enough time
left to stand out in the street for a whole week. And if I were to think that in
my old days I might be compelled to do that very thing&#8212;Sir, I am speaking only
for myself now&#8212;but I cannot imagine how I could still muster the courage to look
people in the face.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. What? With such an opera in
your hands! Remember, I am not doing it for my own sake; I am doing it for art's
sake.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> You overestimate art. Let me
tell you that art is something quite different from what people make themselves
believe about it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span>. I know nothing higher on
earth!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> That's a view shared only by
people like yourself to whose interest it is to make this view prevail
generally. We artists are merely one of bourgeoisie's luxuries in paying for
which they will outbid each other. If you were right, how would an opera like <i>
Walküre</i>
be possible which deals with things the exposure of which is absolutely
abhorrent to the public. Yet when <i>I</i> sing the part of Siegmund, the most
solicitous mothers will not hesitate to bring in their thirteen or fourteen year
old daughters. And indeed, as I am standing on the stage, I know for certain
that not one person in the audience any longer pays the slightest attention to
the action itself. If they did they would get up and out. That's what they
actually did when the opera was still new. Now they have accustomed themselves
to ignoring it. They notice it as little as they notice the air separating them
from the stage. That, you see, is the meaning of what you call art! To this you
have sacrificed fifty years of your life! Our real duty as artists is to produce
ourselves to the paying public night after night under one pretense or another.
Nor is its interest limited to such exhibitions; it fastens itself as
tenaciously upon our private life. One belongs to the public with every breath
one draws; and because we submit to this for money, people never know which they
had better do most, idolize us or despise us. Go and find out how many went to
the theatre yesterday to hear me sing and how many came to gape at me as they
would gape at the emperor of China if he were to come to town tomorrow. Do you
know what the public is after in its pursuit of art? To shout bravos, to throw
flowers and wreaths upon the stage, to have something to talk about, to be seen
by others, to say Ah and Oh, once in a while to take a hand in unhitching a
performer's horses&#8212;these are the public's real wants, and I satisfy them. If
they pay me half a million, I in return furnish a living to a legion of cabmen,
writers, milliners, florists, tavernkeepers. The money is made to circulate.
People's blood is made to circulate. Young girls become engaged, old maids get
married, wives fall victims to their husbands' friends, and grandmothers get no
end of topics for gossip. Accidents and crimes are made to happen. At the ticket
office a child is trampled to death, a lady is robbed of her pocketbook, a
gentleman in the audience becomes insane during a performance. That creates
business for physicians, lawyers ... (he is seized by a fit of coughing.) And to
think in this condition I am to sing Tristan tomorrow!&#8212;I am not telling you
these things out of vanity but to cure you of your delusion. The standard by
which to judge a man's importance in this world is the world itself and not some
fixed conviction one may have acquired through years of brooding meditation. I
did not put myself in the market either; they discovered me. There are no
unappreciated, neglected geniuses. We are not the makers and masters of our own
fate; man is born a slave!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (who has been turning the
leaves of his manuscript). Please, before I go, let me play to you the first
scene of the second act. It's laid in a park, you know, just like the famous
picture: <i>Embarquement pour Cythère</i> ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> But I told you I haven't the
time! Besides what am I to gather from a few detached scenes?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (slowly packing up his
manuscript). I am afraid, Mr. Gerardo, you are somewhat misjudging me. After
all, I am not quite so unknown to the rest of the world as I am to you. My
person and name are known. Wagner himself mentions me often enough in his
writings. And let me tell you, if I die today, my works will be performed
tomorrow. I am as sure of that as I know that my music will retain its value. My
Berlin publisher writes me every day: All that's needed is for you to die. Why
then in the world don't you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> All I can reply to you is
this: that since Wagner's death there hasn't been a call for new operas
anywhere. If you offer new music, you have all conservatories, all singers and
the whole public against you from the start. If you want to see your works
performed, write a music which does not differ the least from what is in vogue
today; just copy; steal your opera in bits and scraps from the whole of Wagner's
operas. Then you may count with considerable probability on having it accepted.
My tremendous hit last night should prove to you that the old music is all
that's needed for years to come. And my opinion is that of every other singer,
of every manager and of the whole paying public. Why should I go out of my way
to have a new music whipped into me when the old music has already cost me such
inhuman whippings?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (offers him his trembling
hand). I am sorry but I fear I'm too old to learn to steal. That's the kind of
thing one has to begin young or one will never learn.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I hope I haven't offended you,
Sir.&#8212;But, my dear Sir,&#8212;if you would permit me&#8212;the thought that life means a hard
struggle to you&#8212;(speaking very rapidly) it so happens that I have received five
hundred marks more than I ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Dühring</span> (looks at <span class="sc">
Gerardo</span> with his eyes wide open, then suddenly starts for the door).
Please, please, I beg of you, no! Don't finish what you meant to say. No, no,
no! That is not what I came for. You know what a great sage has said:&#8212;They are
all of them good-natured, but ...!&#8212;No, Mr. Gerardo, I did not ask you to listen
to my opera in order to practise extortion on you. I love my child too much for
that. No indeed, Mr. Gerardo ...</p>
<p class="right">[Exit through the centre door.]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (escorting him to the door). Oh
please. Sir.&#8212;Happy to have known you, Sir.</p>

<h2>SCENE VIII</h2>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (alone, comes forward, sinks
into an armchair, with basket of champagne in front of him, looks at the
bottles). For whom am I raking together so much money?&#8212;For my children I Yes, if
I had any children!&#8212;For my old age?&#8212;Two more years will make a wreck of me!&#8212;Then
it will be:</p>
<div style="margin-left:4em">
<p class="continue">                &quot;Alas, alas,<br>
                 The hobby is forgotten!&quot;</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE IX</h2>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span>, <span class="sc">Helen Marowa</span>,
later the valet.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (of striking beauty, twenty-seven
years, street dress, muff; greatly excited). I am just likely, am I not, to let
that creature block my way! I suppose you placed him down there to prevent me
from reaching you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (has started from his chair).
Helen!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Why, you knew that I was coming,
didn't you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Valet</span> (in the open door which has been
left so by <span class="sc">Helen</span>; holds hand to his cheek). I did my
very best, Sir, but the lady ... she ... she ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Boxed your ears!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Helen!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Would you expect me to put up
with such an insult?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (to the valet). You may go.
[Exit <span class="sc">Valet</span>. ]</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (lays her muff on a chair). I can
no longer live without you. Either you will take me along or I shall kill
myself.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Helen!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. I shall kill myself! You cut
asunder my vital nerve if you insist on our separation. You leave me without
either heart or brain. To live through another day like yesterday, a whole day
without seeing you,&#8212;I simply cannot do it. I am not strong enough for it. I
implore you, Oscar, take me along! I am pleading for my life!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> It is impossible.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Nothing is impossible if you are
but willing! How can you say it is impossible? It is impossible for you to leave
me without killing me. These are no empty words, I do not mean it as a threat;
it is the simple truth! I am as certain of it as I can feel my own heart in
here: not to have you means death to me. Therefore take me along. If not for my
sake, do it for human mercy's sake! Let it be for only a short time, I don't
care.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I give you my word of honor,
Helen, I cannot do it.&#8212;I give you my word of honor.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. You must do it, Oscar! Whether
you can or not, you must bear the consequences of your own acts. My life is dear
to me, but you and my life are one. Take me with you, Oscar, unless you want to
shed my blood!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Do you remember what I told
you the very first day within these four walls?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. I do. But of what good is that
to me now?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> That there could be no thought
of any real sentiment in our relations?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Of what good is that to me now?
Did I know you then? Why, I did not know what a man could be like until I knew
you! You foresaw it would come to this or you would not have begun by exacting
from me that promise not to make a scene at your departure. Besides do you think
there is anything I should not have promised you if you had asked me to? That
promise means my death. You will have cheated me out of my life if you go and
leave me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I cannot take you with me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Good Heavens, didn't I know that
you would say that! Didn't I know before coming here! It's such a matter of
course! You tell every one of them so. And why am I better than they! I am one
of a hundred. There are a million women as good as I. I needn't be told, I
<i>know</i>.&#8212;But I am ill, Oscar! I am sick unto death! I am love-sick! I am
nearer to death than to life! That is your work, and you can save me without
sacrificing anything, without assuming a burden. Tell me, why can you not?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (emphasizing every word).
Because my contract does not allow me either to marry or to travel in the
company of ladies.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (perplexed). What is to prevent
you?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> My contract.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. You are not allowed to ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I am not allowed to marry
until my contract has expired.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. And you are not allowed to ...?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I am not allowed to travel in
the company of ladies.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. That's incomprehensible to me.
Whom in the world does it concern?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> It concerns my manager.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Your manager?&#8212;What business is
it of his?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> It is his <i>business</i>.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Perhaps because it might affect
your voice?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Why, that's childish!&#8212;<i>Does</i>
it affect your voice?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> It does not.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Does your manager believe such
nonsense?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> No, he does not believe it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. That's incomprehensible to me. I
don't understand how a&#8212;respectable man can sign such a contract!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> My rights as a man are only a
secondary consideration. I am an artist in the first place.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes, you are. A great artist! An
eminent artist! Don't you comprehend how I must love you? Is that the only thing
your great mind cannot comprehend? All that makes me appear contemptible now in
my relation to you is due to just this, that I see in you the only man who has
ever made me feel his superiority to me and whom it has been my sole thought to
win. I have clenched my teeth to keep from betraying to you what you are to me
for fear you might weary of me. But my experience of yesterday has left me in a
state of mind which no woman can endure. If I did not love you so madly, Oscar,
you would think more of me. That is so terrible in you that you must despise the
woman whose whole world you are. Of what I formerly was to myself there is not a
trace left. And now that your passion has left me a burned-out shell, would you
leave me here? You are taking my life with you, Oscar! Then take with you as
well this flesh and blood which has been yours, or it will perish!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Helen ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Contracts! What are contracts to
you! Why, there's not a contract made that one cannot get around in some way!
What do people make contracts for? Don't use your contract as a weapon with
which to murder me. I am not afraid of your contracts! Let me go with you,
Oscar! We'll see if he as much as mentions a breach of contract. He won't do it
or I am a poor judge of human nature. And if he does object, it will still be
time for me to die.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> But we have no right to
possess each other, Helen! You are as little free to follow me as I am to assume
such a responsibility. I do not belong to myself; I belong to my art ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Oh don't talk to me of your art!
What do I care for your art. I've clung to your art merely to attract your
attention. Did Heaven create a man like you to let you make a clown of yourself
night after night? Are you not ashamed of boasting of it? You see that I am
willing to overlook your being an artist. What wouldn't one overlook in a
demigod like you? And if you were a convict, Oscar, I could not feel differently
toward you. I have lost all control over myself! I should still lie in the dust
before you as I am doing now! I should still implore your mercy as I am doing
now! My own self would still be abandoned to you as it is now! I should still be
facing death as I am now!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (laughing). Why, Helen, you and
facing death! Women so richly endowed for the enjoyment of life as you are do
not kill themselves. You know the value of life better than I. You are too
happily constituted to cast it away. That is left for others to do&#8212;for stunted
and dwarfed creatures, the stepchildren of nature.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Oscar, I did not say that I was
going to shoot myself. When did I say that? How could I summon the courage? I
say that I shall die if you do not take me with you just as one might die of any
ailment because I can live only if I am with you! I can live without anything
else&#8212;without home, without children, but not without you, Oscar! I can
<i>not</i> live without <i>you</i>!</p>
<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (uneasy). Helen&#8212;if you do not
calm yourself now, you will force me to do something terrible! I have just ten
minutes left. The scene you are making here won't be accepted as a legal excuse
for my breaking my contract! No court would regard your excited state of mind as
a sufficient justification. I have ten more minutes to give you. If by that time
you have not calmed yourself, Helen&#8212;then I cannot leave you to yourself!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Oh let the whole world see me
lie here!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Consider what you will risk!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. As if I had anything left to
risk!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> You might lose your social
position.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. All I can lose is you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> What about those to whom you
belong?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. I can now belong to no one but
you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> But I do not belong to you!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. I've nothing left to lose but
life itself.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> How about your children?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (flaring up). Who took me away
from them, Oscar! Who robbed my children of their mother!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Did I make advances to <i>you</i>?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (with intense passion). No, no!
Don't think that for a moment! I just threw myself at you and should throw
myself at you again today! No husband, no children could restrain me! If I die,
I have at least tasted life! Through you, Oscar! I owe it to you that I have
come to know myself! I have to thank you for it, Oscar!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Helen&#8212;now listen to me calmly
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes, yes&#8212;there are ten minutes
left ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Listen to me calmly ... (Both
sit down on the sofa.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (staring at him). I have to thank
you for it ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Helen&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. I don't ask you to love me. If I
may but breathe the same air with you ...!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (struggling to preserve his
composure). Helen&#8212;to a man like me the conventional rules of life cannot be
applied. I have known society women in all the lands of Europe. They have made
me scenes, too, when it was time for me to leave&#8212;but when it came to choosing, I
always knew what I owed to my position. Never yet have I met with such an
outburst of passion as yours. Helen&#8212;I am tempted every day to withdraw to some
idyllic Arcadia with this or that woman. But one has his duty to perform; you as
well as I; and duty is the highest law ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. I think I know better by this
time, Oscar, what is the highest law.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Well, what is it? Not your
love, I hope? That's what every woman says! Whatever a woman wants to carry
through she calls good, and if anybody refuses to yield to her then he is bad.
That's what our fool playwrights have done for us. In order to draw full houses
they put the world upside down and call it great-souled if a woman sacrifices
her children and her family to indulge her senses. I should like to live like a
turtledove, too. But as long as I have been in this world I have first obeyed my
duty. If after that the opportunity offered, then, to be sure, I've enjoyed life
to the full. But if one does not follow one's duty, one has no right to make the
least claims on others.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (looking away; abstractedly).
That will not bring the dead to life again ...</p>

<p class="center"><a name="pix_390" href="#pixRef_390"><img src="images/pg390.png" alt="D._Mommsen"></a></p>
<p class="center">D. MOMMSEN</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (nervously). Why, Helen, don't
you see, I want to give back your life to you! I want to give back to you what
you have sacrificed to me. Take it, I implore you! Don't make more of it than it
is! Helen, how can a woman so disgracefully humiliate herself! What has become
of your pride? With what contempt would you have shown me my proper place if I
had fallen in love with you, if it had occurred to me to be jealous! What am I
in the eyes of the society in which you move! A man who makes a clown of
himself! Would you fling away your life for a man whom a hundred women have
loved before you, whom a hundred women will love after you without allowing it
to cause them a moment of distress! Do you want your flowing blood to make you
ridiculous in the sight of God and man?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (looking away). I know very well
that I am asking an unheard-of thing of you but&#8212;what else can I do ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (soothingly). I have given you
all that's in my power to give. Even to a princess I could not be more than I
have been to you. If there is one thing further our relations, if continued,
might mean to you, it could only be the utter ruin of your life. Now release me,
<span class="sc">Helen</span>! I understand how hard you find it, but&#8212;one often
fears one is going to die. I myself often tremble for my life&#8212;art as a
profession is so likely to unstring one's nerves. It's astonishing how soon one
will get over that kind of thing. Resign yourself to the fortuitousness of life.
We did not seek one another because we loved each other; we loved each other
because we happened to find one another! (Shrugging his shoulders.) You say I
must bear the consequences of my acts, Helen. Would you in all seriousness think
ill of me now for not refusing you admittance when you came under the pretext of
having me pass on your voice? I dare say you think too highly of your personal
advantages for that; you know yourself too well; you are too proud of your
beauty. Tell me, were you not absolutely certain of victory when you came?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (looking away). Oh, what was I a
week ago! And what&#8212;what am I now!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (in a matter-of-fact way).
Helen, ask yourself this question: what choice is left to a man in such a case?
You are generally known as the most beautiful woman in this city. Now shall I,
an artist, allow myself to acquire the reputation of an unsociable lout who
shuts himself up in his four walls and denies himself to all visitors? The
second possibility would be to receive you while at the same time pretending not
to understand you. That would give me the wholly undeserved reputation of a
simpleton. Third possibility&#8212;but this is extremely dangerous&#8212;I explain to you
calmly and politely the very thing I am saying to you now. But that is very
dangerous! For apart from your immediately giving me an insulting reply, calling
me a vain conceited fool, it would, if it became known, make me appear in a most
curious light. And what would at best be the result of my refusing the honor
offered me? That you would make of me a contemptible helpless puppet, a target
for your feminine wit, a booby whom you could tease and taunt as much as you
liked, whom you could torment and put on the rack until you had driven him mad.
(He has risen from the sofa.) Say yourself, Helen; what choice was left to me?
(She stares at him, then turns her eyes about helplessly, shudders and struggles
for an answer.) In such a case I face just this alternative:&#8212;to make an enemy
who despises me or&#8212;to make an enemy who at least respects me. And (stroking her
hair) Helen!&#8212;one does not care to be despised by a woman of such universally
recognized beauty. Now does your pride still permit you to ask me to take you
with me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (weeping profusely). Oh God, oh
God, oh God, oh God ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Your social position gave you
the opportunity to make advances to me. You availed yourself of it.&#8212;I am the
last person to think ill of you for that. But no more should you think ill of me
for wishing to maintain my rights. No man could be franker with a woman than I
have been with you. I told you that there could be no thought of any
sentimentalities between you and me. I told you that my profession prevented me
from binding myself. I told you that my engagement in this city would end today
...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (rising). Oh how my head rings!
It's just words, words, words I hear! But I (putting her hands to her heart and
throat) am choking here and choking here! Oscar&#8212;matters are worse than you
realize! A woman such as I am more or less in the world&#8212;I have given life to two
children. What would you say, Oscar ... what would you say if tomorrow I should
go and make another man as happy as you have been with me? What would you say
then, Oscar?&#8212;Speak!&#8212;Speak!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> What I should say? Just
nothing. (Looking at his watch.) Helen ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Oscar!&#8212;(On her knees.) I am
imploring you for my life! For my life! It's the last time I shall ask you for
it! Demand anything of me! But not that! Don't ask my life! You don't know what
you are doing! You are mad! You are beside yourself! It's the last time! You
detest me because I love you! Let not these minutes pass!&#8212;Save me! Save me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (pulls her up in spite of her).
Now listen to a kind word!&#8212;Listen to a&#8212;kind&#8212;word ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (in an undertone). So it must be!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Helen&#8212;how old are your
children?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. One is six and the other four.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Both girls?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. No.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> The one four years old is a
boy?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> And the younger one a girl?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. No.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Both boys?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Have you no pity for them?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. No.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> How happy I should be if they
were mine!&#8212;Helen&#8212;would you give them to me?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (half jokingly). Suppose I
should be as unreasonable as you&#8212;taking it into my head that I am in love with
some particular woman and can love no other! I cannot marry her. I cannot take
her with me. Yet I must leave. Just what would that lead me to?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (from now on growing constantly
calmer). Yes, yes.&#8212;Certainly.&#8212;I understand.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Believe me, Helen, there are
any number of men in this world like me. The very way you and I have met ought
to teach you something. You say you cannot live without me. How many men do you
know? The more you will come to know the lower you will rate them. Then you
won't think again of taking your life for a man's sake. You will have no higher
opinion of them than I have of women.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. You think I am just like you. I
am not.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> I am quite serious, Helen.
Nobody loves just one particular person unless he does not know any other.
Everybody loves his own kind and can find it anywhere when he has once learned
how to go about it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (smiling). And when one has met
one's kind, one is always sure of having one's love returned!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (drawing her down on the sofa).
You have no right, Helen, to complain of your husband! Why did you not know
yourself better! Every young girl is free to choose for herself. There is no
power on earth that could compel a girl to belong to a man whom she doesn't
like. No such violence can be done to woman's rights. That's a kind of nonsense
those women would like to make the world believe who having sold themselves for
some material advantage or other would prefer to escape their obligations.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (smiling). Which would be a
breach of contract, I suppose.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> If <i>I</i> sell myself, they
are at least dealing with an honest man!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (smiling). Then one who loves is
not honest!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> No!&#8212;Love is a distinctly
philistine virtue. Love is sought by those who do not venture out into the
world, who fear a comparison with others, who haven't the courage to face a fair
trial of strength. Love is sought by every miserable rhymester who cannot live
without being idolized by some one. Love is sought by the peasant who yokes his
wife together with his ox to his plow. Love is a refuge for molly-coddles and
cowards!&#8212;In the great world in which I live everybody is recognized for what he
is actually worth. If two join together, they know exactly what to think of one
another and need no love for it.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (once more in a pleading tone).
Will you not introduce me into that great world of yours!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Helen&#8212;would you sacrifice your
own happiness and that of your family for a fleeting pleasure!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. No.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Do you promise me to return to
your family without show of reluctance!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> And that you will not die, not
even as one might die of some ailment!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Do you really promise me!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> That you will be true to your
duties as a mother&#8212;and as a wife!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Helen!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes!&#8212;What more do you want!&#8212;I
promise you.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> That I may leave town without
fear!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span> (rising). Yes.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo.</span> Now shall we kiss each other
once more!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. Yes&#8212;yes&#8212;yes&#8212;yes&#8212;yes&#8212;yes ...</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (after kissing her in a
perfunctory manner). A year from now, Helen, I shall sing again in this town.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Helen</span>. A year from now!&#8212;Yes, to be
sure.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (affectedly sentimental).
Helen! (<span class="sc">Helen</span> presses his hand, takes her muff from the
chair, pulls from it a revolver, shoots herself in the head and sinks to the
floor.) Helen! (He totters forward, then backward and sinks into an armchair.)
Helen! (Pause.)</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE X</h2>

<p class="center">Same as before. The elevator boy. Two chambermaids. A
scrubwoman.
<span class="sc">Müller</span>. proprietor of the hotel. The valet.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Elevator Boy</span> (enters, looks at <span class="sc">
Gerardo</span> and at <span class="sc">Helen</span>). Mr.&#8212;Mr. Gerardo! (<span class="sc">Gerardo</span>
does not move. Boy steps up to <span class="sc">Helen</span>. Two chambermaids
and a scrubwoman, scrubber in hand, edge their way in hesitatively and step up
to <span class="sc">Helen</span>. )</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scrubwoman</span> (after a pause). She's still
alive.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (jumps up, rushes to the door
and runs into the proprietor. Pulls him forward). Send for the police! I must be
arrested! If I leave now, I am a brute and if I remain, I am ruined, for it
would be a breach of contract. (Looking at his watch.) I still have a minute and
ten seconds left. Quick! I must be arrested within that time!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Müller</span>. Fritz, get the nearest
policeman!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Elevator Boy</span>. Yes, Sir!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Müller</span>. Run as fast as you can! (Exit
elevator boy. To <span class="sc">Gerardo.</span>) Don't let it upset you, Mr. <span class="sc">
Gerardo.</span> That kind of thing is an old story with us here.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (kneels down beside <span class="sc">
Helen</span>, takes her hand). Helen! She's still alive! She's still alive! (To <span class="sc">
Müller</span>. ) If I am arrested, it counts as a legal excuse. How about my
trunks?&#8212;Is the carriage at the door?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Müller</span>. Has been there the last twenty
minutes, Sir. (Goes to the door and lets in the valet who carries down one of
the trunks.)</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (bending over <span class="sc">
Helen</span>). Helen!&#8212;(In an undertone.) It can't hurt me professionally. (To <span class="sc">
Müller</span>. ) Haven't you sent for a physician yet?</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Müller</span>. The doctor has been 'phoned to
at once. Will be here in just a minute, I am sure.</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (putting his arms under <span class="sc">
Helen's</span> and half raising her). Helen!&#8212;Don't you recognize me, Helen?&#8212;Come
now, the physician will be here in just a moment!&#8212;Your Oscar, Helen!&#8212;Helen!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Elevator Boy</span> (in the open door). Can't
find a policeman anywhere!</p>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Gerardo</span> (forgets everything, jumps up,
lets <span class="sc">Helen</span> fall back to the floor). I must sing
&quot;Tristan&quot; tomorrow! (Colliding with several pieces of furniture, he rushes out
through the centre door.)</p>

<h2>TRISTRAM THE JESTER (1907)</h2>

<h3>TRANSLATED BY JOHN HEARD, JR.</h3>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>ACT I</h2>


<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Iseult's</span> apartment at St. Lubin.&#8212;A
curtain hung from the ceiling cuts off one-third of the room. This third is
raised one step above the rest of the room. The background is formed by a double
bay-window through which may be seen the tops of some pine trees. In front of a
couch, on a small table, stands a large gold shrine in which rests the magic
brachet Peticru, a toy of jewels and precious metals. Beside it stands a burning
oil torch. The remaining two-thirds of the room are almost empty. A table stands
in the foreground; on the floor lies a rug on which are embroidered armorial
designs. In the middle and at both sides are wide double doors. <span class="sc">
Iseult</span> sits on the couch before the shrine. She is clad in a fur-trimmed
robe. <span class="sc">Brangaene</span> loosens <span class="sc">Iseult's</span>
hair which is divided into two braids. The cold, gray light of dawn brightens
gradually; the rising sun falls on the tops of the trees, coloring them with a
flood of red and gold.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE I</h2>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (singing).<br>
           Brachet of safran and em'rald!<br>
           Oh, brachet of purple and gold<br>
           Once made by the mighty Urgán<br>
           In Avalun's wondrous wold.</p>

<p class="hang4">Oh purple, and safran, and gold,<br>
           When cast in the dim of the night,<br>
           Have magical power to aid<br>
           All lovers in sorrowful plight!</p>

<p class="hang4">Lord Tristram slew mighty Urgán,<br>
           Lord Tristram the loving, the true,<br>
           And pitying sorrowful lovers<br>
           He carried away Peticru.<br>
           Lord Tristram, the thoughtful and valiant,<br>
           Lord Tristram, the noble and high,<br>
           Has sent me this wondrous brachet<br>
           Lest weeping and grieving I die.</p>

<p class="hang4">Lord Tristram, my friend, is unfaithful,<br>
           And God's wrath on him shall descend;<br>
           Though cruelly he has betrayed me,<br>
           My love even death cannot end.</p>

<p class="hang4">Iseult with her hair of spun gold,<br>
           Where rubies and emeralds shine,<br>
           When the end of her life is at hand,<br>
           Round Tristram some charm can entwine.</p>

<p class="hang4">&#8212;When Tristram too shall die....</p>

<p class="hang5">[<span class="sc">Iseult</span> stands up, extinguishes the
light,<br>
               and, flooded by her hair, steps to the window.<br>
               <span class="sc">Brangaene</span> opens a chest from which she
takes<br>
               robes, combs, a mirror, and several small<br>
               boxes. She prepares a small dressing table.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    The light begins to
filter through the land;<br>
           Behold, the trees with storm-bow'd tips drop down<br>
           A thousand drops into the moss below<br>
           That seem as many sparks, all cold and bright.</p>

<p class="hang4">Each day is followed by another one,<br>
           And then another day, and after each<br>
           Comes night. Thus runs my life's long chain of beads,<br>
           All black and white, endless, and all the same.</p>

<p class="right">[She turns and throws off her cloak.]</p>

<p class="hang4">Give me my new white cloak, and comb my hair,<br>
           I pray, Brangaene.&#8212;O, it aches!</p>

<p class="hang5">  [<span class="sc">Brangaene</span> throws a cloak over her
shoulders.<br>
               <span class="sc">Iseult</span> sits down at the dressing table
while<br>
               <span class="sc">Brangaene</span> combs her hair, dividing it
into<br>
               strands and throwing it, as she combs it,<br>
               over <span class="sc">Iseult's</span> shoulder.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br>                     The
comb<br>
           Slides like a keel. Its narrow teeth can find<br>
           No bottom, neither shore in this blond sea.<br>
           I never saw thy hair so full, Iseult,<br>
           Nor yet so heavy! See the golden gold.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    It aches&#8212;!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br>       And here it's damp
as though last night<br>
           It secretly had dried full many tears.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    I wonder if Lord
Tristram spent last night<br>
           By his new bride&#8212;and if he calls her all<br>
           Those sweetest names he made for me.<br>
             Perhaps<br>
           He sat upon her couch and told her tales<br>
           Of me that made them laugh&#8212;! I wonder too<br>
           If she be fair. Lord Tristram's new-wed bride!&#8212;</p>



<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE II</h2>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> turns quickly as her page comes
in by the right hand door. He carries a chess-board and sets it down on the
table in the foreground.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Were then thy dreams too
painfully like this life,<br>
           Paranis, that thou hast outstripped the sun<br>
           And now, with eyes all red and swollen, star'st<br>
           So heavily?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>                Your
pardon. Queen Iseult,<br>
           I could not sleep. Oh lady, what a night!<br>
           I tremble still!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                      The
night indeed was wild.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>   Ay, like the sea the
gale whips up. The wind<br>
           Swept all the covers from my bed and left<br>
           Me cold and trembling. Branches beat the wall<br>
           Above my head like demons of the storm.<br>
           The owls kept screaming in the groaning eaves<br>
           And whispered like lost souls in agony!<br>
           Hark! Hear him roar! Oh God, it's Husdent!<br>
           Oh listen to him roar. I never heard<br>
           A hound thus howl before!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Peace, child. He cries<br>
           Thus every night since he has lost his lord.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>   What? Every night and
yet King Mark can sleep?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    King Mark can sleep as
all good knights can sleep<br>
           At any time and any where, while we,<br>
           Poor souls, must like a beggar sue for sleep<br>
           As for an alms.</p>
                        <p class="right">(To <span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. )<span style="letter-spacing:20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;
						&nbsp;</span><br>
                           The mirror and the cloak.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>   Pray tell me, Queen
Iseult, why came we here<br>
           With good King Mark and left Tintagel's halls?<br>
           Why journeyed we to St. Lubin? The place<br>
           Is gloomy and an awful wood grows round<br>
           The castle walls. Oh 'tis an awful wood.<br>
           I am afraid, Iseult.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                         <span style="letter-spacing:50px"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Yea, boy, the wood<br>
           Is black and gloomy here. Give me some oil,<br>
           Brangaene, for my lips are parched and dried<br>
           From weeping all this never-ending night.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span> (goes to the casement).<br>
           Above Tintagel, lo, the sky was blue;<br>
           The sun shone on a foreign ship that came<br>
           Across the seas and lay at anchor there<br>
           And made it look like gold. The ship came in<br>
           As we rode through the gate. I wish that I<br>
           Were at Tintagel once again and saw<br>
           That ship. For here black clouds obscure the sun<br>
           And hang close to the ground; they fly along<br>
           Like mighty ghosts. The earth smells damp and makes<br>
           Me shiver&#8212;Ugh&#8212;!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (steps to the casement beside
him and puts her arm about his neck).<br>       Nay, not today, for see,<br>
           The sun will shine and pour its golden rays<br>
           E'en o'er the Morois.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span> (falling on his knees).<br>
           Oh Queen Iseult pray take the fairy dog<br>
           Into thy hands and it will comfort thee&#8212;<br>
           That wondrous brachet, Tristram's latest gift.<br>
           For, lo, since from Tintagel we have come<br>
           My heart is troubled by a wish to ask<br>
           Of thee a question, for Brangaene says<br>
           That when thou think'st of certain things thou weep'st<br>
           But I have never felt the like.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br><span style="letter-spacing:90px">&nbsp;
&nbsp;</span>                                   Poor boy!<br>
           I lay awake the whole night through and yet<br>
           Not once did I take Petikru to me,<br>
           So ask, my child! What wouldst thou know!<br>
             Mine eyes<br>
           Are dry, for all my tears are spent, and gone.<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>   Is this the wood where
thou and Tristram dwelt,<br>
           As people say, when ye had fled away?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    'Tis true this wood once

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br> Inquire not too much,
Paranis, lest<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>   There's more they say,
yet I believe no more.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    And what do people say,
Paranis?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>
Why,<br>
           They say Lord Tristram, since he fled away<br>
           To save his life, and, ay, to save thine too.<br>
           Forgot thee. Queen Iseult, and thy great love<br>
           And wed another in a foreign land.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    They call her Isot of
the Fair White Hands. </p>

<p class="right">[A pause.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>   When I'm a man, and wear

           I'll love and serve thee with a truer love<br>
           Than Tristram did.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                   How old
art thou, my child?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>   When I first came to
serve thee as a page<br>
           Thirteen I was; that was a year ago.<br>
           I'm fourteen now, but when I dream, I dream<br>
           That I am older and I love thee then<br>
           In knightly fashion, and my sword is dull'd<br>
           And scarred by blows that it has struck for thee.<br>
           My heart beats high when I behold thy face;<br>
           My cheek burns hot or freezes ashen pale.<br>
           And then, at other times, I dream that I<br>
           Have died for thee, only to wake and weep<br>
           That I am still a child!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Listen to me,<br>
           Paranis. Once, wandering, a gleeman came<br>
           Two years agone and sang a lay in Mark's<br>
           High hall; but, see! I said not it applied<br>
           To us, this song of his. A song it was<br>
           And nothing more. This lay told of a queen,<br>
           A certain queen whose page once loved her much,<br>
           With all the courtesy of Knighthood's laws;<br>
           Whose every glance was for his lady's face;<br>
           Whose cheeks alternately went hot and cold<br>
           When she was near. But when the King perceived<br>
           His changing color and his burning looks,<br>
           He slew the boy, and, tearing out his heart,<br>
           Now red, now pale, he roasted it, and served<br>
           It to his queen and told her 'twas a bird<br>
           His favorite hawk had slain that day.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>
Tell me,<br>
           I pray, my lady, when a Knight has won<br>
           His spurs may he write songs?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Ay, that he may.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>   Since that is so, I'd
rather sing than fight.<br>
           I'll go from court to court and sing in each<br>
           How Tristram was untrue to Queen Iseult!<br>
           I will avenge thy wrongs in songs instead<br>
           Of with the sword, and every one who hears<br>
           My words shall weep as thou, my queen, has wept.<br>
           I like the lay about that page's heart<br>
           Thou toldst me.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Remember it, my child;<br>
           Brangaene knows the melody thereof.<br>
           And she shall teach it thee that thou mayst learn<br>
           The lay.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span> (at the window).<br>
                     The King's awake; I hear him call<br>
           His hounds.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                 Then go,
Paranis, bear to him<br>
           My morning and my wifely greeting; say<br>
           I rested well this night; that thou hast left<br>
           Me overjoyed and happy that the day<br>
           Is fair. Now haste thee, boy, for soon<br>
           The Gaelic barons through the gates shall ride<br>
           Coming to pay their homage to King Mark,<br>
           Delay not, child, and if the King shall grant<br>
           Thee spurs, with mine own hands I'll choose thee out<br>
           The finest pair, and deep my name shall stand<br>
           Engravèd in the gold. Go greet the King.</p>

<h2>SCENE III</h2>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Lord Tristram has kept
true unto my name<br>
           At least&#8212;if not to me! 'Tis now the tenth<br>
           Year that I mourn for him! In countless nights<br>
           Of endless agony have I repaid<br>
           Those other nights of happiness and bliss.<br>
           Through age-long days now beggared of their joy<br>
           I have atoned for all the smiles of yore.<br>
           Unkindly have ye dealt with me, sweet friend!<br>
           Disloyal Tristram! God shall punish thee.<br>
           Not I.<br>
<p class="hang5">[<span class="sc">Brangaene</span> kneels weeping beside her

<p class="hang4">       And thou, dear one, sweet sister, come!<br>
           My sorrow's past enduring! Help me, help!<br>
           At Lubin here the very walls have tongues;<br>
           At Lubin here the sombre forest moans;<br>
           At Lubin here old Husdent whimpers day<br>
           And night unceasingly. 'Twas at Lubin<br>
           I parted from him last, my dearest friend,<br>
           And to his parting vows I answered thus:<br>
           &quot;Take, friend, this golden ring with em'rald stone,<br>
           And if in thy name one shall bring it me,<br>
           No dungeon walls, no castle gates, no bolts<br>
           Shall keep me far from thee.&quot; And he: &quot;I thank<br>
           Thee, dearest lady, and I swear that if,<br>
           At any time, in any place, one calls<br>
           On me by thy sweet name I'll stand and wait<br>
           And answer in thy name by day or night.&quot;<br>
           And then&#8212;and then&#8212;he rode away!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br>
Iseult!<br>
           Iseult, my dearest, might I die, for I,<br>
           Wretch that I am, am most at fault,<br>
           Too ready for deceits and secret ways!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Because I love a life,
and better still<br>
           A death, that's great from savage unrestraint,<br>
           Such as I found in mighty Tristram's love,<br>
           'Tis not thy fault. And formerly when thou<br>
           Didst lend me thine own maiden smock to wear<br>
           Upon my bridal night with Mark, since mine<br>
           Was torn when I set foot on Cornish ground,<br>
           Thou didst fulfill what, as my guardian friend,<br>
           Thou hadst foreseen in earlier days. Weep not<br>
           Because I weep; Lord Tristram's treachery<br>
           Is his, not ours. For this it is I weep.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br> Thou shouldst not say,
he is not faithful still.<br>
           Dear sister. What know we of him or his?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    That he has married!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br>                    Ay,
her name's Iseult.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    My name! I shudder when
I think thereon.<br>
           And lo, his perjured tongue rots not, nor cleaves<br>
           Unto his teeth, nor does the name he calls<br>
           Her by choke in his throat and strangle him.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br> Mark me, Iseult, I had
not meant to speak,<br>
           But now I must: a servant of King Mark's<br>
           Spoke lately of that ship we saw sail in<br>
           And then cast anchor 'neath Tintagel's walls.<br>
           A merchant ship it is, he said, and hails<br>
           Direct from Arundland. Now send<br>
           And bid these merchants leave their ship and come,<br>
           That they may tell what they have seen or heard<br>
           Of Tristram and his fate.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span> (runs in and leaps upon the

                                 Oh Queen, there come<br>
           Three Gaelic earls! Dinas of Lidan first.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span> (hastening to his side).<br>
           Come then, Iseult, and from the casement here<br>
           Behold the faithful Dinas, Tristram's friend!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>
           The one in coat of mail who rides behind<br>
           Who is the man, Brangaene, canst thou see?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br>
           Oh God! Denovalin, ill-omened bird<br>
           Of grim Tintagel.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                      Arund?
Didst thou say<br>
           A merchant ship sailed in from Arundland?<br>
           That great gold sail, Brangaene, came across<br>
           The ocean to Tintagel? What? A ship,<br>
           And merchant men from Arund? Speak, friend, speak!<br>
           Thou talk'st of Arund, and remain'st unmoved!<br>
           Brangaene, cruel, speak and say the men<br>
           Are on their way to me, or are now here!<br>
           Torture me not!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br>                 Nay,
hear me speak, Iseult;<br>
           I said a servant of King Mark's said this;<br>
           I know not whether it be true; to know<br>
           We must be back within Tintagel's walls.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (in rising agitation).<br>
           Wait till we're back within Tintagel's walls?<br>
           Not see the merchants till we are gone back,<br>
           And linger thus for three whole days, say'st thou?<br>
           Nay, nay, Brangaene, nay I will not wait.<br>
           'Twas not for this ten never-ending years<br>
           I sat upon Tintagel's tower and watched<br>
           With anxious eyes the many ships sail o'er<br>
           The green expanse from sky to sky. 'Twas not<br>
           For this; that day by day Paranis went,<br>
           At my behest, down to the port, while I<br>
           Sat counting every minute, one by one,<br>
           Until he should return, and tell me tales<br>
           Of ships and lands indifferent as a fly's<br>
           Short life to me!&#8212;And now thou tellest me<br>
           A ship is here; a great gold sail lies moor'd<br>
           Hard by Tintagel's walls, a ship in which<br>
           Men live, and speak, and say when asked:<br>
           &quot;Where come ye from!&quot; &quot;From Arundland we sail.&quot;<br>
           Go quick, Brangaene; to Tintagel send, I pray,<br>
           At once some swift and faithful messenger,<br>
           And bid him with all haste lead here to me<br>
           These merchants over night. I need both silks<br>
           And laces, samite and the snowy fur<br>
           Of ermines, and whatever else they have.<br>
           All that they have I'll gladly buy! Let them<br>
           But ride with speed!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br>                    Ay,
ride as peddlers do!<br>
           Yet will I send Gawain, since 'tis thy wish,<br>
           And with him yet another.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>
Queen Iseult,<br>
           May I go with Gawain? I'll make them ride,<br>
           These merchant-men! I'll stick my dagger twixt<br>
           Their shoulder blades and prick them 'till from fear<br>
           They fairly fly to thee!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>

           All glorious as the summer day that shines<br>
           O'er all the world! Now welcome, my Iseult!<br>
           Now welcome to Lubin! These gallant lords<br>
           Are come to greet thee&#8212;Dinas, Ganelun,<br>
           Denovalin.&#8212;They have not seen thee now<br>
           For many months. And ye, my noble lords.<br>
           Is she not blonder than of yore?<br>
<p class="hang5">[He glances at a locket that hangs about his neck.]<br>
                                            For see!<br>
           This lock of hair Lord Tristram brought me once.<br>
           Behold it now, 'tis almost black next hers.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    I greet thee, Dinas,
Lord of Lidan, friend,<br>
           Most loyal friend:&#8212;and thou. Lord Ganelun,<br>
           Most heartily, for many days have pass'd<br>
           Since last we met.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
           Ay, many days, Iseult.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Hast thou forgot
Tintagel's King and Queen?<br>
           'Twas not so once.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>
           I've been at Arthur's court<br>
           Nigh on two years, and there have taken part<br>
           In many deeds of high renown. 'Tis this<br>
           Has kept me from Tintagel and from home.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     And I, fair Queen
Iseult, am growing old;<br>
           I've left the saddle for the pillow's ease.</p>
                            <p class="center">(Pointedly.)</p>
           <p class="hang4">I see the chess-board stands prepared and so,<br>
           If Mark permits, 'tis I who in his place<br>
           Will lead the crimson pawns today, as we<br>
           Were wont to do in former days. I love<br>
           The game but have no friend with whom to play.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     Ay, Dinas, good it is to
have some one<br>
           Who loves us near us in our twilight years;<br>
           So play today with Goldenhaired Iseult.<br>
           Perchance it may amuse her too, for oft<br>
           She seemeth sad, and mourns as women do<br>
           Who have no children.&#8212;God forgive us both!<br>
           But come, my lords, first let us drink a pledge<br>
           Of greeting, and permit this man to make<br>
           His peace with my fair queen. I hate long feuds.<br>
           Come, friends, come, let us drink, for all this day<br>
           We'll spend together in good fellowship.<br>

<h2>SCENE V</h2>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span> (calmly and insinuatingly).<br>
           Am I a vulture, Queen Iseult, that thou<br>
           Art silent when I am within thy cage?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (angrily).<br>
           My Lord Denovalin, how dar'st thou show<br>
           Thyself thus brazenly before me here?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>Harsh words the Queen
Iseult is pleased to use!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    And I shall beg the King
that he forbid<br>
           Thee to appear within a mile around<br>
           The castle with thy visor raised.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>
King Mark<br>
           Is not my over-lord. I'm not his liege.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    And I tell thee, my Lord
Denovalin,<br>
           Thy face is more abhorred by me than plague;<br>
           More hateful than dread leprosy! Away!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>More measured should'st
thou be in thy reproof.</p>
<p class="center">(Much moved.)</p>
<p class="hang4">It was for thee I came today, harsh Queen!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (passionately).<br>
           When last thou stoodst before my face, my Lord,<br>
           Naked I was, and men at arms prepar'd<br>
           The glowing pyre whereon thy jealousy<br>
           Had doomed my youthful body to be burned!<br>
           Calm wast thou then; no quiver moved thy face,<br>
           Untroubled by thy deed. Dost thou forget?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>And Tristram stood beside
thee then, as he<br>
           Had stood, when I accused thee to King Mark,<br>
           And when I see him standing next to thee,<br>
           My eyes grow dim and all the world seems red<br>
           With blood. 'Twas him I saw, not thee, Iseult,<br>
           Else had I died of sorrow and of shame.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    What, <i>thou</i>? <i>
Thou</i> grieve! <i>Thou</i> die of shame? The stones<br>
           Shall soften and shall melt ere thou, my lord,<br>
           Hast learned what pity means!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>
Thou dost misjudge<br>
           Me, Queen Iseult, for when thy foot first touched<br>
           The Cornish strand as thou stepped'st from thy ship<br>
           And came to be the bride of Mark, I saw<br>
           Thee then, and by the Lord, a solemn oath<br>
           Of loyalty upon thy golden hair<br>
           To thee I swore! Oh thou wast wondrous fair!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    And I, my Lord, what
evil did I thee?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>Thou loved'st Tristram.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
What? Denovalin,<br>
           When, by a miracle of God, I have<br>
           Escaped the fiery death which thou prepared'st;<br>
           When, with these tender hands of mine, I bore<br>
           Before my judges, and without a burn<br>
           The glowing iron, and with sacred oath<br>
           Have sworn, thou darest doubt Almighty God's<br>
           Decree, and dar'st accuse me still, and say<br>
           I love Lord Tristram with a guilty love?<br>
           This nephew of my wedded spouse! Of this<br>
           I'll make complaint unto my sponsors, Lord!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span> (calmly).<br>
           Almighty God thou hast, perhaps, deceived,<br>
           But we, at least, Iseult, we must be frank,<br>
           Though enemies, and deal straightforwardly<br>
           With one another.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                       Go,
thou were-wolf!&#8212;Go!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>There was a time when I,
too, heard the song<br>
           Of birds in spring-time; but the fragrant breath<br>
           Thy golden hair exhales,&#8212;that hair which I<br>
           Have seen flow rippling through Lord Tristram's hands&#8212;<br>
           Has made me hard and rough&#8212;a very beast!<br>
           I live pent up within my castle walls<br>
           As some old wolf! I sleep all day and ride<br>
           At night! Ay, ride until my steed comes home<br>
           With gasping nostril and with bloody flank,<br>
           And lies as dead when morning comes! My hounds<br>
           Fall dead along the road! And yet, may be,<br>
           That long before the earliest cock has crowed<br>
           I cry aloud upon thy name each day<br>
           Like one who swelters in his own life's blood!<br>
           Remember this, for hadst thou once, Iseult,<br>
           Beside me ridden ere the night grew dark,<br>
           Perchance this hatred of all living things<br>
           Had never got such hold upon my soul.<br>
           Remember this, throughout the many things<br>
           Which shall, ere evening, come to pass.<br>
           And evening comes to thee, Iseult,&#8212;to me,<br>
           To all! And so 'tis best thou understand<br>
           The secret of the past fairly to judge.<br>
           This is the peace I fain would have with thee.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    I am afraid&#8212;afraid&#8212;of
thee!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>
Thou shouldst<br>
           Not fear, Iseult, these words so seemingly<br>
           Devoid of sense!</p>
                      <p class="center">(Changing the subject.)</p>

                             <p class="hang4">At dawn today I rode<br>
           					Along the Morois.</p>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Ay, since that's the
road<br>
           That leads the straightest from thy lofty hall<br>
           To St. Lubin.&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>                 I met a
quarry there!<br>
           A quarry wondrous strange! Shall I, Iseult,<br>
           Go bring it bound to thee?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (in great anxiety).<br>
I wish no fur,<br>
           Or pelts slain by thy hand, Denovalin&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br> That I believe, Iseult,
yet it might please<br>
           King Mark.</p>
<p class="center">(Breaking out passionately.)</p>
                          <p class="hang4">It might be that once more<br>
           				Thou felt'st the burning touch of death, all hot<br>
           				And red. And if no safe retreat there were<br>
           				For thee in Cornwall, save my castle walls,<br>
           				And not a man in Cornwall stood to shield<br>
           				Thy golden tresses from the hangman's hand<br>
           				Except myself! If such the case what wouldst<br>
           				Thou do if I said &quot;come?&quot;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (wild with terror and despair).<br>
           If such the case,<br>
           Oh God of Bethlehem! If such the case<br>
           I'd fling my arms about the neck of Death,<br>
           And, clinging close to him, I'd spit at thee,<br>
           Denovalin! Those wrinkles, cold and hard,<br>
           About thy mouth on either side disgust<br>
           Me! Go, Denovalin! I loath thee! Go!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>I go, Iseult, for thou
hast made thy choice;<br>
           Forget it not. Forget not, too, the pact<br>
           Of peace my soul has made with thine. Farewell!<br>
           I'll go and bid Lord Dinas come to play<br>
           At chess with thee. Play quickly, Queen Iseult,<br>
           Thy time is short, and short shall be thy game!</p>

<h2>SCENE VI</h2>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Oh God, how bitter are
his words! They cut<br>
           Like sharpen'd swords and burn like hissing flames!<br>
           What is his will? His speech, though witless, ay,<br>
           And senseless too, insults and threatens me.&#8212;<br>
           It warns me too&#8212;of what?&#8212;Oh God, I quake!<br>
           If but Brangaene came, or Dinas came!<br>
           They come not and this creeping fear&#8212;how hard<br>
           It grips my soul!&#8212;More Gaelic barons come&#8212;!<br>
           How often have I stood concealed here<br>
           And seen him come proud riding through the gate!<br>
           My friend that comes no more! How grand he was!<br>
           His lofty stature did o'ertop them all!<br>
           How nobly trod his steed!&#8212;Dear Tristram, friend.<br>
           Does thy new Isot's heart beat quick as mine<br>
           At but the thought of thy dear step?</p>
<p class="center">(Kneels down in front of the little shrine.)</p>
<p class="hang4">                                 And thou,<br>
           Oh little brachet, thinks thy lord of me,<br>
           As I of him!&#8212;&quot;For they who drink thereof<br>
           Together so shall love with every sense<br>
           Alive, yet senseless&#8212;with their every thought<br>
           Yet thoughtless too, in life, in death, for aye&#8212;.<br>
           Yet he, who once has known the wond'rous bliss<br>
           Of that intoxicating cup of love,<br>
           Spits out the draught disloyally, shall be<br>
           A homeless and a friendless worm&#8212;a weed<br>
           That grows beside the road.&quot; Oh Tristram, Lord.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Dinas</span> enters. <span class="sc">Iseult</span>
rushes toward him.</p>

<p class="hang4">Dinas of Lidan! Dearest friend, most true!<br>
           With what has this man threatened me? Of what,<br>
           Then, warned?&#8212;friend, speak, for round me whirls the world;<br>
           My brain is dizzy with each thought!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
My Lord<br>
           Denovalin has bid me come to thee<br>
           To play at chess. He said thou wast in haste.<br>
           And has he, as Mark ordered him, made peace<br>
           With thee?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                    Made
peace with me! I told<br>
           Thee, Dinas, that he has stirred up the past<br>
           With gloomy words and threatened me. He spoke<br>
           Forebodingly of coming days&#8212;; I fear<br>
           His words and know not what is brewing o'er<br>
           My head!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>                 Denovalin
has threatened thee!<br>
           That bodes no good!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    What think'st thou,
Dinas? Speak!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     It makes me almost fear
that I was not<br>
           Deceived this morn as through the mist I rode.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Oh Dinas!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>                  For I saw a
man who rode<br>
           As secretly, and stole along the way<br>
           Concealèd in the murky mists of dawn.<br>
           I&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>          Dinas!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>                 Tristram's

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Oh Dinas, speak!
(Softly.) My friend. Lord<br>

<p class="hang4">Thou speak to him?</p>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span> (sternly).<br>          Twice
called I him. He fled.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Oh, why didst thou not
call him in my name?<br>
           He would have stood thee answer then, for that<br>
           He swore to me he'd do, by day or night<br>
           At any place....</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>I called him in thy name,<br>
           And yet he fled away.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                         He
fled from thee?</p>
<p class="center">                          (Angrily.)</p>
<p class="hang4">It was not Tristram then! How dar'st thou speak<br>
           Such slander 'gainst my Lord!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
I swore that I<br>
           Would be thy friend, and for thy sake, Iseult,<br>
           His friend. But now I say Lord Tristram broke<br>
           The oath he swore to thee, and on this day<br>
           Hath wronged thee grievously, Iseult.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (heavily and brokenly).<br> The
spouse<br>
           Of Isot of the Fair White Hands appeared<br>
           To thee, say'st thou, and broke his parting oath.<br>
           The last he swore to Iseult Goldenhaired?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span> (enters in ill-suppressed
excitement).<br>
           Lord Dinas, from King Mark I come. He bids<br>
           Thee come to him straightway with all despatch,<br>
           For in the name of justice calls he thee.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>Oh Dinas, Dinas, Tristram
broke his oath&#8212;!<br>
           Lord Tristram broke his oath&#8212;!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
And dost thou know,<br>

           And its fulfilment from thy head?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     I go to stem with all

<p class="hang1">The High Hall of St. Lubin Castle.&#8212;Bay windows. On the right,
in the background is a wide double-door. On the left, in the background, and
diagonally to it stands a long table surrounded by high-back chairs. The chairs
at either end of the table are higher than the others and are decorated with the
royal arms. Against the wall on the left stands a throne.</p>
<p class="hang1">Four Gaelic barons stand, or sit about the table. <span class="sc">
Lord Ganelun</span> enters.</p>




<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE I</h2>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Baron</span>. <br>   And canst thou tell us
now. Lord Ganelun,<br>
           What's taking place that we are summoned here<br>
           In council while our legs are scarcely dry<br>
           From our long ride?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>                       A
welcome such as this<br>
           I like not, Lords!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>                       I
know no more than ye,<br>
           My lords, who are but lately come.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Baron</span>. <br>
And where<br>
           Is Mark, the King?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>
Instead of greeting us<br>
           He sends a low born knave, and bids us wait<br>
           Within these dry and barren walls.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (stands up).<br>
                                              By God,<br>
           I feel a wish to mount my horse and ride<br>
           Away!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">5th Baron</span> (entering).<br>
                Do ye, my Lords, know why King Mark<br>
           Lets Tristram's savage hound, old Husdent live?<br>
           It needed but a little that it caused<br>
           My death!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">4th Baron</span>. <br>              Just now?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">5th Baron</span>. <br>                       As
I rode by its cage<br>
           It leap'd against the bars, and made them shake<br>
           With such a noise that my affrighted horse<br>
           Uprear'd, and headlong sprang across the court.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>  The hound is wolflike;
none can go within<br>
           His cage. Three keepers has he torn to death.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">5th Baron</span>. <br>A wild and dang'rous
beast! I would not keep<br>
           The brute within my castle walls.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Baron</span> (walks irritatedly to the
window).<br>  How this<br>
           Long waiting irks my soul, good friends!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span>. <br>
So cold<br>
           A welcome have I never yet received,<br>
           And new the custom is!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>
Have patience, sirs,<br>
           It seems King Mark and Lord Denovalin<br>
           Discuss in secret weighty things&#8212;<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">
3rd Baron</span>. <br>                                 &#8212;And wish<br>
           To teach us how to wait!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>                      Nay,
here's King Mark!</p>

<br>
<h2>SCENE II</h2>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Mark</span> and <span class="sc">Denovalin</span>
enter; behind them comes a man-at-arms who closes the door and stands against
the wall beside it. <span class="sc">Mark</span> holds a parchment in his hand,
and, without noticing the barons, walks agitatedly to the front of the stage. <span class="sc">
Denovalin</span> goes behind the table and places himself between it and the
throne. The barons rise.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span>. <br>Does Mark no longer know
us that he greets<br>
           Us not?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>
           And dost thou know, my Lord&#8212;?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (turning angrily upon the baron).<br>
           Am I<br>
           A weak old man because my hair is gray,<br>
           Because my hands are wrinkled, ay, and hard,<br>
           Because at times my armor chafes my back?<br>
           Am I an old and sapless log? A man<br>
           Used up who shall forever keep his peace?</p>
                     <p class="hang4">(Controlling himself.)</p>
           <p class="hang4">I crave your pardon, Lords, pray take your seats.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     Thou badst me come to
thee.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
Yes, Dinas, yes,<br>
           So take thy place.</p>
             <p class="hang5">(He controls his emotion with great difficulty<br>
               and speaks heavily.)<br>
                            And ye, my noble friends,<br>
           	Give ear. A great and careful reckoning shall<br>
           	Take place 'twixt you and me. Your sanctioning word<br>
           	I wish, for what I am about to do,<br>
           	For yonder man has, with an evil lance,<br>
           	Attacked me and he has so lifted me<br>
           	Out of my saddle that my head doth swim,<br>
           	And trembles from the shock, and so I pray<br>
           	You to forgive the churlish greeting ye<br>
           	Received; 'twas accident, not scorn. I bid<br>
           	You welcome, one and all, most heartily.</p>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Baron</span>. <br>
           We greet thee, Mark.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>                  But tell
us now what thing<br>
           So overclouds thy mind; thy welfare dwells<br>
           Close intertwined with ours.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span> (unfolding the parchment).<br>
           And now, my Lords,<br>
           Are any of the witnesses not here<br>
           Who signed the contract and decree which Mark<br>
           Drew up with Tristram and with Queen Iseult!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span>. <br>'Tis then of this decree
that thou wouldst speak?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Baron</span>. <br>
           I signed.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">4th Baron</span>. <br>
                       And I.</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">5th Baron</span>. <br>                    And
I.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
Three witnesses<br>
           There were, and ye are three. 'Tis good, my Lords,<br>
           That we are all assembled here.</p>
<p class="hang5">[He speaks brokenly and with all the marks<br>
               of mental suffering and suppressed emotion.]</p>
                                              <p class="hang4">Ye know<br>
           									How long I lived alone within these
												walls<br>
           									With my good nephew Tristram and not
												once<br>
           									Did any woman cross my threshold
												o'er.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">5th Baron</span>. <br>And 'twas through us that
things were changed; we cried<br>
           Upon thee for a son and heir.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>
Iseult<br>
           Then came from Ireland to be thy Queen.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span> (coldly, firmly, and in a
loud voice).<br>
           Nobly escorted, in Lord Tristram's care!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (softly).<br>
           I wooed Iseult, and much it pleased me then<br>
           To call this sweet and noble lady mine,<br>
           And so to honor her. But see, it was<br>
           But for a single day, then came this man</p>
                      <p class="center">(Points to <span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. )</p>
           <p class="hang4">And spake to me and said: &quot;Thy wife Iseult<br>
           And Tristram whisper in the dark!&quot; And since<br>
           The speaking of that evil word, this world<br>
           Has turned to hell, and through my veins my blood<br>
           Has run like seething fire for her sake,<br>
           Who was my wife, and cried for her as though<br>
           She were not mine!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Baron</span>. <br>                   But
thou didst not believe<br>
           These evil words?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>                         No,
never in my life<br>
           Did I fight off a foeman from myself<br>
           More fiercely than these words.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span> (sternly).<br>
           But soon this man<br>
           Came back and said: &quot;The hands of Queen Iseult<br>
           And Tristram's hands are locked when it is dark.&quot;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     And then I slunk about
them like a wretch,<br>
           My lords; I spied upon their lips, their hands,<br>
           Their eyes! I watched them like a murderer;<br>
           I listened underneath their window-sills<br>
           At night to catch their dreaming words, until<br>
           I scorned myself for this wild wretchedness!<br>
           Nothing, nothing I found, and yet Iseult<br>
           From that time on was dearer than my God<br>
           And his Salvation!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>                       Yet
thou ever held'st<br>
           Iseult in honor and esteem!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
Ay, that I did,<br>
           Friend Ganelun, but soon that man there came<br>
           And whispered in mine ear: &quot;Art thou stone blind?<br>
           Thy nephew Tristram and thy Queen Iseult<br>
           Are sleeping in each other's arms by day<br>
           And night!&quot; Oh God! Oh God! My Lords, I set<br>
           To work&#8212;and thought I'd caught the pair!&#8212;Poor fool!</p>
<p class="center">                         (He hides his face.)</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     'Tis so; and thou badst
build a mighty pyre<br>
           Of seasoned wood and well dried peat. But God<br>
           Almighty blew the fire out. They fled,<br>
           The twain together, to the Morois land.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span>. <br>     And then one night I
stole upon them both.<br>
           (Lord Dinas knew of this alone, my Lords.)<br>
           Iseult was sleeping, and Lord Tristram slept<br>
           An arm's length scarce before me in the moss<br>
           All pale and wan, and breathed so heavily,<br>
           So wearily, like some hard hunted beasts.</p>
                            <p class="center">(Groaning.)</p>
           <p class="hang4">Oh God, how easy was it then!&#8212;See what<br>
           Befell! There, 'twixt their bodies lay a sword,<br>
           All naked, ay, and sharp&#8212;<br>
           'Twas Morholl's sword!<br>
           &#8212;Then silently I took it, and I left<br>
           Mine own, and, like a fool, I wept at their<br>
           Great purity!</p>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>               Was
Tristram so much moved<br>
           By this exchange of swords that he gave back<br>
           Thy wife Iseult?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (violently).<br>
           And, God! I took her! See<br>
           His cunning counsel circumvented then<br>
           The red hot steel and made her innocence<br>
           Seem more apparent, and her hands shone white,<br>
           Unburned, and all unscarred like ivory<br>
           After the test! My nephew Tristram fled,<br>
           Exiled, and the decree that ye all know<br>
           Was sealed. So harken now, ye witnesses<br>
           Of the decree: if Tristram were to break<br>
           The bond and secretly, and in disguise<br>
           Return to Cornwall&#8212;</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Baron</span>. <br>
God forbid!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">4th Baron</span>. <br>
Yet if<br>
           Lord Tristram should do this and break the bond,<br>
           And thus endanger both his life and Queen Iseult's&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">5th Baron</span>. <br>           If such the
case they lied to thee,<br>
           King Mark, and unto God!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
They lied! They lied!<br>
           Ay, man, they lied to me and unto God!<br>
           And now I need no longer feel my way<br>
           Nor tap about me in the dark, nor bump<br>
           My soul against my blindness! Ay, they lied!<br>
           My bed was foul; my life a jest for knaves,<br>
           For they had lied. But then, behold, that man<br>
           There came,&#8212;Denovalin I hate thee!&#8212;came<br>
           And said Lord Tristram broke the bond&#8212;</p>
<p class="right">[The Barons spring up.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span>. <br>
How so?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>What knows he?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Baron</span>. <br>
           Speak, Denovalin!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>
Thou say'st<br>
           Lord Tristram broke the bond that holds his life?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">5th Baron</span>. <br>I'll not believe it!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">4th Baron</span>. <br>
           Tristram wed, ye know,<br>
           The daughter of King Kark of Arundland.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Baron</span>. <br>
           Denovalin must bring us proofs!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
Gently,<br>
           My Lords. Before the high tribunal shall<br>
           He speak. Go, call the Queen.</p>
<p class="right">[The man-at-arms goes.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
King Mark,<br>
           Why dost thou hasten to believe this tale?<br>
           Remember, 'tis Denovalin who speaks.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     'Tis not a matter of
belief, my friend,<br>
           I wish to know if for her sake he came;<br>
           To see her once again&#8212;no more. The rest<br>
           I know, and I know, too, the end of this;<br>
           This game that's played about my life, my blood.<br>
           Mine honor!</p>

<h2>SCENE III</h2>

<p class="hang1">The guardsman announces the queen who enters the hall followed
by

as she appears.</p>
<br>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Guardsman</span>. <br>       Place! Iseult the
queen comes! Place!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (quietly and gently).<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (takes an angry step toward her,
checks himself, and stares at her a moment. He speaks slowly and without
moving).<br>
           Lord Dinas, bid Iseult of Ireland draw near!</p>
<p class="hang5">[<span class="sc">Iseult</span>, without waiting for <span class="sc">

           <p class="hang4">Lord Dinas, bid Iseult of Ireland draw near!<br>
           And sit there by the board&#8212;there at the head<br>
           And facing me.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    And may I ask thee now<br>
           What this extraordinary custom is,<br>
           That twice thou dost repeat it, Mark? In mine<br>
           Own land of Ireland I never saw<br>
           A man thus treat his wife. So, if it suits<br>
           Thy will,&#8212;I'll stand!</p>
<p class="hang5">[Neither <span class="sc">Mark</span> nor the barons move.<br>

               upon his head as on the head of a dog.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>            Thou call'dst
me, Mark, and bad'st<br>
           Me come in terms full stern and harsh&#8212;I came,<br>
           For 'tis my heartfelt duty to obey.<br>
           Since thou art good to me and kind. Thou know'st<br>
           This hall, these men, that stand around, awake<br>
           Full many a painful memory in my heart,<br>
           And so I crave a swift reply. What will<br>
           Ye of me here?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (roughly).<br>              Why
was Gawain sent forth<br>
           In secret to Tintagel from Lubin?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    He went not secretly,
but openly,<br>
           My Lord, and that because some merchant-men<br>
           Came to Tintagel from across the seas<br>
           With merchandise. I wished to bid them come<br>
           To me that I might choose me from their stock the wares<br>
           That pleased me and the many things I need.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (scornfully).<br>
           The purchase must be made at once, I trow!<br>
           Since here, more than elsewhere, thou need'st such things.<br>
           'Tis true that fifteen beasts of burden stayed<br>
           Behind, all laden with thy things alone,<br>
           Unnoticed by a well beside the road,<br>
           Iseult, I recollect me now!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Nay, Lord,<br>
           Yet St. Lubin brings me full many a sad<br>
           And weary hour. I, therefore, thought to gain<br>
           Some slight diversion and amusement too<br>
           To soothe my woe. Thou know'st the joy I have<br>
           Of mingled masses of bright colored things<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>              I rode
today at dawn,<br>
           And, coming through the Morois, saw, while yet<br>
           The mist was hanging in the trees, around<br>
           A curving of the road, a man who rode.<br>
           Full proud and straight he sat upon his steed,<br>
           But yet he seemed to wish that none should see<br>
           Him there, for carefully did he avoid<br>
           The clearer spots, and peering round about,<br>
           He listened and he keenly watched, then turned<br>
           Into a thicket when afar he heard<br>
           The hoof-beats of my horse. I followed him,<br>
           And soon I was as near as a man's voice<br>
           Will carry. Loud and haughtily I called<br>
           To him, but then he drove the spurs so deep<br>
           Into his steed that, like a wounded stag,<br>
           It sprang into the air and dashed away.<br>
           I followed close behind, and bade the man<br>
           In knightly and in manly honor stand.<br>
           He heeded not my words and fled away,<br>
           And then I cried aloud that he should stand,<br>
           And called him by Iseult the Goldenhaired.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (passionately and firmly).<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span>. <br>Who says, proud Queen

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (her voice becomes proud and
cold).<br>
           My Lord Denovalin, I'll kiss thy hands<br>
           If thou wilt say my husband's nephew stood<br>
           And bided you, for sorely would it vex<br>
           My heart if such a knight should flee from such<br>
           A man as thou! 'Twould shame me much, for know,<br>
           My Lord Denovalin, I scorn and hate<br>
           Thee as a cur!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Denovalin</span> (suppressing his emotion).<br>
                            If Tristram stood or fled<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
That vexes me<br>
           Indeed, for now, my Lords, I turn to you<br>
           With deeper and more serious complaints<br>
           Against Lord Tristram that so rashly he<br>
           Has broken Mark's decree, thus forcing me<br>
           To share a guilt of which my soul is clean!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (crouches on the steps of the

           So smooth that when one grasps them they escape<br>
           The hand like shining, slippery, squirming snakes!<br>
           And she has subtle words, caressing words,<br>
           And words that set the mind on fire; hot words<br>
           That burn, and haughty ones that swell and puff<br>
           Like stallions' nostrils, and toss high their heads!<br>
           Oh she has words, and words, and many words<br>
           With which to frame her lies!</p>

           Dinas!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>           I, too, did meet a
man today<br>
           At early dawn whom I first held to be<br>
           Lord Tristram, nephew of King Mark.<br>
           Since from the east I rode and thou, my Lord<br>
           Denovalin, came through the Morois land<br>
           From thy good castle in the west, and since<br>
           Lubin stood as a central point between<br>
           Us both, Lord Tristram must have been two-fold<br>
           That in the east and in the west he crossed<br>
           My path, and at the self-same hour, the road<br>
           Of Lord Denovalin. This cannot be<br>
           And so one of the men was not the true<br>
           Lord Tristram; one of us was therefore wrong.<br>
           And if 'twas one, then why not both<br>
           My Lord Denovalin and I?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
Dinas,<br>
           Had I not known thee from thy youth I might<br>
           Have held thee guilty with Iseult! Has she<br>
           Ensnared thee too with perjured oaths and false<br>
           And lying countenance, that thou dost seek<br>
           To die for her so eagerly? Thy hair<br>
           Is gray like mine. Thou dreamest, man,<br>
           Denovalin has pledged his word that he<br>
           Has seen Lord Tristram! Ponder well ere thou<br>
           Take up his downflung glove.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>
Yet Dinas may<br>
           Be right.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Baron</span>. <br>             I think so
too.</p>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">5th Baron</span>. <br>

                                            My Lords,<br>
           I've pledged my word! Take heed unto your tongues!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>  It seems but right to me
that Queen Iseult<br>
           Should not be put to death until the true<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    By God! my Lords, it is

           If I shall live or die, as though I were<br>

           I will that ye bow down before my blood,<br>
           Since ye do not bow down to womanhood!<br>
           I will that ye permit me to return<br>
           To my apartments and that ye do not<br>
           Here keep me standing like a haltered beast!<br>
           King Mark may let me know your will when ye<br>
           Decide. And now I wish to go.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (in swelling anger).<br>
Oh hear her,<br>
           My Lords, hear her, does she not make one wish.<br>
           Groaning, to cast oneself before her feet;<br>
           To kiss her very shoes when she can find<br>
           Such noble sentiments and words! Behold<br>
           Her there! Is she not fuller than the whole<br>
           Wide world of smiles and tears. And when she laughed<br>
           With that fair mouth, entrancing and all pale,<br>
           Or silvery bright that God's whole world did dance<br>
           And sing in God's own hand, 'twas not on me<br>
           She smiled. And when upon her lowered lids<br>
           There trembled tears like drops of pearly dew<br>
           Upon a flower's brim, 'twas not for me<br>
           She wept! A phantom hovered over us<br>
           In all the sweet dark hours; 'twas for this ghost,<br>
           The phantom likeness of Lord Tristram's self,<br>
           She wept and smiled, true to her soul, though all<br>
           The while her soulless body lay all cold<br>
           Within mine arms deceiving me with smiles<br>
           And tears! She shall not die till Tristram can<br>
           Be found. Bethink you, Lords, the minutes that<br>
           Ye grant that mouth to smile! The minutes that<br>
           Ye grant those eyes to weep! Whom will it not<br>
           Deceive,&#8212;her laughter and her tears! Both you,<br>
           And me, and God! But I will change her smiles<br>
           To tears; her weeping to the bitter laugh<br>
           Of hideousness, that we at last may rest,<br>
           And be secure from all her woman's wiles!<br>
           And since she shall not die, then I will give her<br>
           As a gift! This surely is my kingly right,<br>
           For I am Mark, her lawful spouse and lord.<br>
           Today at noon, when in the sun her hair<br>
           Shall shine the brightest in the golden light<br>
           Unto the leprous beggars of Lubin<br>
           I'll give her as a gift!</p>

           I do not know how women nobly born<br>
           Can live on through the loathsome leper test,<br>

           Or let my flesh be torn between the dogs<br>
           And leprous human vultures of Lubin.<br>
           I swear that I have never thrilled with love<br>

           A maiden still, as clean and pure as snow<br>

flight of steps, under an arcade of columns, stands the door of the chapel. At
the left of the gate entering the courtyard are some buildings, behind which may
be seen the high castle walls surmounted by trees. The road from the Castle to
the church is laid with carpets. In the middle of the stage, on the right,
stands a stone well. In the background is a crowd of people held back by three
armed guards. At the foot of the steps, one on each side, stand two men-at-arms.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Guard</span> (pushing the child back into
the crowd).<br>
           My little friend, get back! Now see, I'll make<br>
           A line upon the ground, and if thy toes,<br>
           But by a hair's breadth, cross that line again,<br>
           I'll drop my spear on them and they shall be<br>
           As flat as any barley cake. [Laughter.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Girl</span>. <br>
Ha, Ha!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Girl</span>. <br>   Hast thou become a
baker, oh Gilain!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Guard</span> (lifting his mailed hand).<br>
           Ay, wench, would'st see me knead my dough?</p>

<p class="right">[Laughter.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Boy</span>. <br>
Be still<br>
           I hear the crier's voice from down below!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Girl</span>. <br>    He's wandered up and
down the streets since dawn<br>
           And called until my blood runs cold!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">The Boy</span>. <br>
Hush.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">The Girl</span>. <br>
Hark!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Voice of the Crier</span> (distant and
ringing).<br>
           Today at noon, because King Mark has found<br>
           Her faithless and untrue, shall Queen Iseult<br>
           Be given to the lepers of Lubin,&#8212;<br>
           A gift to take or leave. And, furthermore,<br>
           Lord Tristram, who was once her paramour,<br>
           Transgressed King Mark's decree by entering<br>
           His realm. Whoever catches him and brings<br>
           Him quick or dead unto the King shall have<br>
           One hundred marks of gold for his reward.<br>
           'Tis good King Mark's decree that every one<br>
           Should hear and know these things that I have cried.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Child</span>. <br>   Oh, I'm afraid! Will he
come here, that man?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">The Girl</span>. <br>  I know it all by heart,
and still he cries!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Man</span>. <br>     Ay, let him cry!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Another Man</span>. <br>                Lord
Tristram, he's a fox;<br>
           To catch him they must have a good deep pit<br>
           Or else he'll scratch them so that all their lives<br>
           They'll think thereon.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Girl</span>. <br>
Tristram's a noble lord,<br>
           I'd shield him an I could.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Second Girl</span>. <br>
I want to see<br>
           The Queen close by.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Third Girl</span>. <br>
Ay, so do I!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Fourth Girl</span>. <br>
I'll strew<br>
           Some flowers in her path as she goes past.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Girl</span>. <br>  My father made her once
a pair of shoes<br>
           Of fine white satin, bound with golden clasps<br>
           And crimson 'broidery. He says her feet<br>
           Are delicate and small; as white and slim<br>
           As are the Virgin Mary's in the shrine<br>
           That stands within Tintagel's lofty church<br>
           Above the great high altar.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">4th Girl</span>. <br>
Poor, poor soul!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Old Woman</span>. <br> Ay, let her see where
those white feet of hers<br>
           Have carried her!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">3d Guard</span> (to a boy who has climbed upon
the wall).<br>
           Hey, thou! Come down! The wall<br>
           And rocks are full an hundred fathoms high,<br>
           So, if thou fall, thy howling will not help.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">The Boy</span>. <br>   I want to sit here when
the lepers come!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Another Boy</span>. <br>
           A good place that! I'll climb up too.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Fourth Boy</span>. <br>
I too!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st GUARD</span>. <br> Now none of you may stay
within the court<br>
           To stare when Queen Iseult is given o'er<br>
           Unto the lepers. Mark has granted this<br>
           Unto the Queen since 'twas her only wish.<br>
           Ye all must go into the church.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Man</span>. <br>
May none<br>
           Then stay without and watch the lepers?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Another Man</span>. <br>
's wounds!<br>
           Why then I came for nothing, all this way!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Woman</span> (indignantly).<br>
           Oh shame, thou beast, would'st gloat and make a show<br>
           Of that which one scarce dares to think of? Fie!<br>
           For such foul thoughts thou shouldst be thrown<br>
           To Husdent to devour!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Guard</span>. <br>
Stop wrangling, there!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Girl</span>. <br>    Poor Queen! I pity her!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Second Girl</span>. <br>
King Mark's too harsh!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Man</span>. <br>     She's made a cuckold of
him, Girl!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Old Woman</span>. <br>
And now<br>
           He's tossing her with those new horns of his!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Young Shepherd</span>. <br>
           Is then the Queen Iseult so wondrous fair<br>
           As she is said to be?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Girl</span>. <br>
Hast thou not seen<br>
           The Queen?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shepherd</span>. <br>               No, never
yet!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Girl</span>. <br>
He's never seen<br>
           The Queen?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Boy</span>. <br>               Behold, here's
one who never saw<br>
           Our Queen!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Voice</span>. <br>          Who is he?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st GUARD</span>. <br>            Speak, where
wast thou, friend,<br>
           When Queen Iseult stood bound here to the stake?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Girl</span>. <br>    All naked in her
wondrous beauty&#8212;</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Another Girl</span>. <br>
All<br>
           For her great love.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">The Boy</span>. <br>                     We all
did see her then.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shepherd</span>. <br>  I've come since then
from Toste in the hills.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Woman</span>. <br>   Here, let this fellow
stand in front, that he<br>
           May see the Queen's fair face before this swarm<br>
           Of vultures has devoured it.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st GUARD</span>. <br>
Come here;<br>
           If thou hast never seen the Queen thou may'st<br>
           Stand here beside the steps.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shepherd</span>. <br>
I thank thee.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Soldier</span> (drawing him beside him).<br>
Here!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Voice</span>. <br>   Here come the soldiers!</p>

<h2>SCENE II</h2>

<p class="hang1">Soldiers march past and enter the church. The church door stays
open.</p>
<br>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Girl</span>. <br>    I pray thee, Gilain, who
will lead the Queen?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st GUARD</span>. <br> The hangman and King

             Friends, cross yourselves. The crucifix!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shepherd</span> (leans forward so that he can
see across the courtyard into the castle).<br>
           Behold, she comes! My God, how beautiful&#8212;!<br>
           An angel&#8212;!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">The Soldier</span> (as <span class="sc">

                     That, my friend, is but her maid<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Guard</span>. <br>     Back! Stand back!
Thou shalt not push!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shepherd</span>. <br>  Oh there! Behold, she is
a fairy! Yea,<br>
           And she is fairer than Gimella far!<br>
           I'll fall upon my knees when she goes past.<br>
           She's wondrous fair, ay, fairer than a flower,<br>
           A lily&#8212;See&#8212;!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">The Soldier</span> (as <span class="sc">

                     Stand up, thou knave, for that's<br>
           Brangaene. She's our lady's faithful maid.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shepherd</span>. <br>  She too was fair! Can

           What wondrous women Mark has at his court!<br>
           Such ladies have I never seen&#8212;There dwell<br>

<p class="hang5">[<span class="sc">Iseult</span> walks past between <span class="sc">

               sound. The soldiers and the crowd follow<br>

<h2>SCENE III</h2>

<p class="hang1">The lepers enter the courtyard. They are a wild pack dressed in
gaudy rags, and rumpled, armless cloaks with hoods; carrying long staves and
crutches; with colored cloths bound about their sinister foreheads. Their faces
are sunburnt, their hair is snow-white and streams in the wind. Some have their
heads shaved. Their arms and feet are bare. Altogether they present a motley
appearance, though the hardships of their life, as a band forced to live
together, give them the aspect of weather-beaten and dried chaff driven hither
and thither by the wind. They stand shyly and rock unsteadily on their dried and
shrunken legs&#8212;silent and restless. Like ghosts of the noonday, they try to hush
their voices throughout the scene.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iwein</span> (is the first to enter; the
others file past him).<br>
                      Come quick! They've all gone in!</p>

Right here<br>
           The cat shall catch the bird!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Young Leper</span> (wearing a wreath, made
of three or four<br>
           large red flowers, in his dark hair).<br>
                                              Heisa! Heisa!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iwein</span>. <br>     Speak softly, there,
lest ye disturb the mass.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">An Old Leper</span> (feeble, and supporting
himself on a crutch, in the tone of the town crier, almost singing).<br>
           Today shall Queen Iseult, our good King's spouse<br>
           Be given to us, the lepers of Lubin&#8212;<br>
           So cried the herald!&#8212;</p>

           His faithlessness sticks to him like black slime!<br>
           Go tell him that!&#8212;I hate him in this mask!<br>

<h2>SCENE VI</h2>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Soldier</span> (in subdued tones).<br>
What? Dost<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Soldier</span>. <br>             I'm not
ashamed! There's none<br>
           But weeps, save Mark alone! The very stones<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Soldier</span>. <br>         It makes me
shudder when I think<br>
           Of it.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Soldier</span>. <br>      Come, come, let's
all go home.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Girl</span>. <br>

The Queen!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Voice</span>. <br>         Who? Where?</p>

and does not move!</p>


<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span> (rushes up and throws himself

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Soldier</span> (pulling him away).<br>
Stand back there, boy!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>
Oh let<br>

           Oh, Queen Iseult, how pale thou art!&#8212;But, see,<br>
           She breathes!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Soldier</span>. <br>      The Queen still
breathes!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Paranis</span>. <br>
She is not dead!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Gimella</span>. <br>   What's this?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Boy</span>. <br>              The lepers

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Girl</span> (to <span class="sc">Gimella</span>).<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Man</span>. <br>
Untouched and pure!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Woman</span>. <br>
A great,<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Voice</span>. <br>
Is she asleep?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">A Man</span>. <br>     See, one has wrapped her
in a cloak!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Shepherd</span> (calling aloud).<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Soldier</span>. <br>
I'll to the gate<br>
           And ask the guards if they have seen some sign<br>
           Or token how this miracle occur'd!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (cries angrily).<br>
           I'll crucify the man who asks!</p>
<p class="hang5">[All heads turn then in his direction and a<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     Did Lord Denovalin

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st GUARD</span>. <br>
Here, at the throat.<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Voices</span>. <br>
Oh listen! See,<br>

           Had falsely testified against the Queen!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     Then let the executioner
strip off<br>

           Shall he bind to a horse's tail, and drag<br>

           Soft pillows. Strew fresh flowers round about<br>
           Her bed, and moisten all her robes and clothes<br>
           With sweetest perfumes. Kneel ye down and pray<br>
           When she doth speak to you, for she must be<br>

<h2>ACT IV</h2>

<br>
<br>
<p class="hang1">The High Vaulted Hall of the Castle.&#8212;In the middle of the hall
on the left opens a high, wooden staircase. In the background on the left,
bay-windows; on the right, a broad, barred door. Through the grating one sees
the outer court. In the middle of the wall on the right is a wide fireplace on
each side of which jut out low stone benches. In front of the windows stands a
table at which <span class="sc">Dinas</span> and <span class="sc">Ganelun</span>,
the First and Second Barons, are playing chess. In the foreground, a table on
which chess-boards stand prepared for play. The table by the stone-bench stands
on a dais which is shut off from behind by a railing. On the dais and on the
floor are carpets. Servants take wine-flagons from a sideboard which stands on
the left beside the stairs, and place them in front of the players. In front of
the raised table <span class="sc">Ugrin</span>, the King's Jester, is asleep.
The oil-torches give only a dim light. For a moment the players continue their
game in silence. </p>

<br>
<h2>SCENE I</h2>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span>. <br> Take heed unto thy
queen, Lord Ganelun,<br>
           Unless thou willingly dost sacrifice<br>
           Her to my pawns, as Mark gave Queen Iseult<br>
           Unto his lepers!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>
Wait! for see, I move<br>
           My bishop back.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>             Check! Dinas,
check and mate!<br>
           Thou mad'st it easy, friend. Thou never shouldst<br>
           Have sacrificed the knight, for thus my rook<br>
           Escaped, attacking thee.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
Forgive; my thoughts<br>
           Were troubled, ay, and wandered from the game.</p>
<p class="hang5">[Two knights come in from the courtyard.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Knight</span>. <br> I cannot make one ray
of sense from all<br>
           These strange occurrences, my Lords! I greet<br>
           Thee, Ganelun!</p>
<p class="right">[Shakes hands with the Barons.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2nd Knight</span> (shaking hands).<br>
                         At chess! At chess my Lords!<br>
           Your blood must run full slowly in your veins!</p>
<p class="right">[Comes forward.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>  King Mark has bid us
play, and order'd wine<br>
           For us to drink, since otherwise 'twould be<br>
           A dull and sombre evening here tonight<br>
           Within the castle hall, for Queen Iseult,<br>
           I ween, will stay in her retirement.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Knight</span>. <br> King Mark bade us come
hither too.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span>. <br>
&quot;Oh God!<br>
           Men! Men! Bring lights and let me see the face<br>
           Of human beings 'round about!&quot; So cried<br>
           My cousin Mark not half an hour agone,<br>
           As one on whom the mirth of loneliness<br>
           Falls all too heavily!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>                     What
think ye, Lords,<br>
           Of this most wondrous thing?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Knight</span>. <br>
And do ye know<br>
           That Kaad, King Mark's old stable groom, beheld<br>
           St. George leap from the battlement where wall<br>
           And rock drop off an hundred fathom sheer?</p>
<p class="hang5">[The Barons stand up and crowd about him.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span>. <br>St. George?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>        What's that thou
say'st?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
Dost thou know more?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Knight</span>. <br> I know but what old Kaad
himself recounts;<br>
           That, as he led Mark's charger down to drink,<br>
           There suddenly appeared before his eyes<br>
           The lofty shape of good St. George, erect,<br>
           Upon the wall!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (crossing himself).<br> God
save my soul!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>
And then?<br>
           What happened then?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Knight</span>. <br>                     Kaad
thought at first<br>
           He was some mortal man and cried to him<br>
           To heed; but in that selfsame moment leapt<br>
           The holy knight, and cleared the wall, and fell<br>
           The hundred fathoms. But when Kaad ran up,<br>
           With all the speed he might unto the spot,<br>
           St. George had vanished and had left no trace.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span>. <br>No trace?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>         'Tis strange!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>                          A
wondrous thing!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>
But say,<br>
           By what did Kaad first recognize the saint?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Knight</span>. <br> I know not, but he says
'twas he; and all<br>
           The people, are rejoicing at this new<br>
           And wondrous miracle of good St. George.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Knight</span>. <br> What says King Mark
about this miracle,<br>
           This saving of the Queen by God Himself?<br>
           Hast seen him, Dinas?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span> (returning to the table). Ay, his
heart and mind<br>
           Are heavy and his soul distressed.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Knight</span>. <br>
And Queen<br>
           Iseult?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Knight</span>. <br>      What said the King
of her?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>
The King<br>
           Refused to see her, or to speak with her,<br>
           Since neither dares to speak of this foul deed<br>
           Which has occurred; its memory still throbs,<br>
           And tingling flows throughout their blood.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>
And yet<br>
           He sent the Queen, and without message too,<br>
           The head that pledged a perjured oath today,<br>
           Upon a silver shield. And well he did.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Knight</span>. <br> My Lord Denovalin a
victim fell<br>
           Unto a saintly and a holy hand,<br>
           But died ingloriously!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
As he deserved<br>
           So died he. Sir.</p>
<p class="hang5">[The Barons and Knights sit down again<br>

               and walks about. He is oppressed and<br>
               agitated. At length he stops, and, leaning<br>
               against the end post of the bannister,<br>
               listens to the conversation of the others.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Knight</span>. <br>                   A
leper has been stoned<br>
           Because he cried throughout Lubin that 'twas<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
Such leaps<br>
           By God or devil can alone be done.</p>

<h2>SCENE II</h2>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
True, Lord Ganelun!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span> (springing up).<br>
           The King!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span><br>       The King here!
Pardon, sire!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
I thank<br>
           You all, my Lords, that ye were not enraged<br>
           And angered at a weak old man, and came<br>
           Again to me. I would not willingly<br>
           Have spent this night alone.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">2d Baron</span>. <br>
Most cheerfully<br>
           We came. The Queen's miraculous escape<br>
           O'er joys us all.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span>. <br>             There lack
but three to make<br>
           The tale complete; those three, my Lords, who stood<br>
           As sponsors of the bond.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
They're coursing through<br>
           The gloomy forest paths and seek to catch<br>
           That which, since God hath spoken, cannot be<br>
           Therein. I've sent my riders to recall<br>
           Them here to me.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>                Give me thy
hand, King Mark,<br>
           For I am glad that thou didst err!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (his voice is bitter and
despairing).<br>
                                              I, too,<br>
           Am glad, for if this morning I appeared<br>
           A wreckless youth, a foolish boy who dared<br>
           In arrogant presumption to assert<br>
           Himself and to rebel against your word,<br>
           Forgive me. Passion is the heritage<br>
           Of man; his deeds the natural consequence<br>
           Of passion. Think ye not the same? And see,<br>
           How God, now for the second time, has wrought,<br>
           And sternly proved the truth! Is it, perchance,<br>
           His will that I should learn unseeingly,<br>
           Unquestioningly to revere His stars<br>
           On which our actions here on earth depend?<br>
           What think ye, sirs? for so it seems to me;<br>
           And therefore hath He hid from me that which<br>
           Most eagerly I wish to know, so that<br>
           Before this veiled uncertainty, my blood<br>
           Ran riot in my veins. But from this day<br>
           I'll change my mode of life; I will regard<br>
           My blindness and His unavoidable<br>
           Decree; for wisdom lies in piety,<br>
           As says an ancient proverb; hence I will,<br>
           From this day on, learn piety that I<br>
           Become a very sage for wisdom.</p>
<p class="right">[Goes away.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span> (calling to <span class="sc">Mark</span>).<br>
Ay, cousin, make thyself a monk!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (turning back).<br>

           In friendly wise, as I will overlook<br>
           Your sins with all my heart. But, if a man<br>
           Grown lately wise may counsel you, sin not;<br>
           Your work is the beginning, God's the end.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span> (calling out to him).<br>
           Amen.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>                  I've broken
in upon your game<br>
           My friends, and chattered on. Forgive it me;<br>
           Resume your play and cups; drink on, I pray.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span>. <br>            My wit has fallen
off, say'st thou?<br>
           Decay of time, believe me Mark; for wit<br>
           Is wine, and wine is poured into a cup<br>
           Of sparkling gold, and not into a crack'd<br>

<p class="right">[Hands him his jester's sceptre.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">Here, hit thyself! Behold the ring is gone!<br>
           My wit's too precious for a ringless cup.<br>
           At Easter tide I'll seek me out as lord<br>
           Some jovial soul who loves his wine; who plays<br>
           Wild pranks, and gives his wife away when he<br>
           Is tired of her!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (sitting down on the stone bench).<br>
                                 Friend Ugrin, I warn<br>
           Thee, heed thy tongue!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span>. <br>                    Ay,
cousin! Ay, 'twere best<br>
           Since thou'st forsworn all quarreling!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
I wish<br>
           That I might put thee on the rack and have<br>
           Thee whipped before I go to rest! Instead<br>
           I'll give thee two broad marks of gold if thou<br>
           Can'st move Iseult to laughter; and I'll give<br>
           Besides the gold a brand-new cloak to wear<br>
           In winter time!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span>. <br>                Well lined?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (takes him by both ears).<br>
I've set my heart<br>
           Upon it that Iseult shall laugh, so do<br>
           Thy best, my friend!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span> (stands up).<br>
                         With some well-chosen words,<br>
           Perhaps, I briefly might describe to her<br>
           The leper's throng! What say'st thou, cousin?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
Fool!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span>. <br>    Or I might ask her what
it's like when one's<br>
           Own husband, from unfeeling jealousy,<br>
           Ordains one to be burnt; or yet again<br>
           I might, with due solemnity, implore<br>
           Her to be kind&#8212;to love thee once again,<br>
           Good cousin! Surely she must laugh at that!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>     Peace, fool! Thou
weariest me.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span>. <br>

<br>
<h2>SCENE III</h2>

<p class="hang1">The Knights and Barons rise; <span class="sc">Mark</span> springs up and steps
back a pace.
<span class="sc">Iseult</span> remains standing on the bottom step. <span class="sc">
Brangaene</span>, <span class="sc">Gimella</span> and
<span class="sc">Paraniss</span> are behind her.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
I beg of you,<br>
           My Lords, consider what is past as 'twere<br>
           A dream, since otherwise we could not find<br>
           Fit words or proper sentiments to stand<br>
           Before each other with unblushing cheek,<br>
           For very shame and horror at this deed.</p>
<p class="right">[She steps down into the hall.]</p>
<p class="hang4">My Lords, I bid you welcome, one and all!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>  I kiss thy mantle's hem,
oh Queen!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">1st Baron</span>. <br>
So do<br>
           We all who stand before thee now. We feel<br>
           That thou art holy, Queen Iseult!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Ye do<br>
           Me wrong in praising me too much, good friends.<br>
           I did but swear the truth and keep what I<br>
           Had sworn. Continue now your play. I would<br>
           Not hinder you!</p>
<p class="hang5">[She turns to <span class="sc">Mark</span>; both stare at each<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (after a short pause, quietly and
kindly).<br>
           Play thou with Dinas first, since I, this morn,<br>
           Did interrupt thy game. I promised him<br>
           That he should play with thee.</p>

               drawn with suffering, against the bars<br>
               of the grating. His head is shaved and<br>
               his clothes are torn and ragged.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span>. <br>
Laugh at me, Queen.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Tell me, Ugrin, why
should I laugh at thee?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span>. <br>    I beg thee laugh; most
fondly I implore<br>
           Thee laugh at me, Iseult. My cousin here<br>
           Hath promised me much gold if I can make<br>
           Thee laugh at me but once&#8212;I want that gold<br>
           So much!&#8212;Come, laugh at me, Iseult!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
First earn<br>
           Thy gold, good fool. Be off and let us play.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span> (kneels down by <span class="sc">
Mark</span> beside the chest).<br>
           Thy wife's not in her sweetest mood today,<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>
A truce<br>
           To thy dull jokes! Come, play the game. Sir Knave!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br> I'll take thy castle,
Dinas! Heed thy game.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span> (humming).<br>
           Oh once there was a mighty King,<br>
             Who had a lady fair.<br>
           This King did love his beauteous dame<br>
             As though his wife she were&#8212;</p>

           There peers a man.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span>. <br>                 Where, boy?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ganelun</span>. <br>                      Sleep

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Mark</span> (on the stairs).<br>
Come, Dinas, come<br>

           My heart is sorrowful tonight!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Dinas</span> (following him up the stairs).<br>
I'll stay<br>

<h2>SCENE VI</h2>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Ugrin</span>. <br>    Ay, so they are! &quot;Whip,
whip the fool!&quot; We wrack<br>
           Our weary brains to make a jest and then,<br>
           In payment, we are whipped if they so feel<br>

<p class="hang5">[He goes to the table where the food stands,<br>

<p class="hang5">[He draws a cloak from under the stairs.]</p>
<p class="hang4">'Tis here, beneath the stairs,<br>
           I sleep.&#8212;A very kennel! 'Tis a shame.</p>
<p class="right">[He eats again.]</p>
<p class="hang4">
           Wilt thou not eat a morsel of what's left<br>

           'Tis not forbidden, friend; our cousin lets<br>
           Us eat and drink of what is left.</p>

<p class="hang5">[He goes into the middle of the hall and<br>
               bends down to look into the Strange<br>

<p class="right">[Comes close to the Strange Jester.]</p>
           <p class="hang4">I'll wrap thee close within my cloak that thou<br>
           May'st sleep. Dost thou not wish to sleep!<br>
           Why then I'll sing a song to make thee sleep. Alas!<br>
           I know but joyous, silly songs! Come lay<br>
           Thee down.</p>

<p class="hang5">[He sits on the bench and draws the head<br>

                <p class="hang4">Thou look'st not happy, brother. Hast<br>
           		A sorrow? Tell it me; here canst thou rest<br>
           		At ease, and I will sing a song. Thou seemst<br>
           		A child to whom one must sing songs to make<br>
           		It sleep. I'll sing the song that Queen Iseult<br>
           		Is wont to sing at even when she thinks<br>
           		Of Tristram, her dear friend, sitting beside<br>
           		Her open casement. 'Tis a pretty song.</p>

<p class="hang5">[With bowed head and closed eyes he hums<br>
               very softly as if in his sleep. The body<br>
               of the Strange Jester under the black<br>
               cloak that covers it is shaken by sobs<br>
               of anguish.]</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>ACT V</h2>
<br>
<p class="hang1">Same as Act IV.&#8212;The first glow of dawn shines through the
grated door and windows, becoming brighter until the end of the Act. The Strange
Jester sits cowering on the steps of the dais. <span class="sc">Brangaene</span>
comes hesitatingly down the steps; she carries an oil-lamp in her hand.</p>


<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE I</h2>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span> (her voice is muffled by
fear).<br>
           Art thou still here, thou ghastly being? Ghost<br>
           Of awful midnight hours?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
                             Brangaene I<br>
           Am here, and here I shall remain.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span> (looking for something on the
ground).<br>
                                            Methought<br>
           King Mark had paid thy jests with whips and had<br>
           Then driven thee away; and yet thou sitst<br>
           Here in the self-same place and starest still<br>
           With blear'd and fish-like eyes. Dost thou not know<br>
           That day is come? Fool, if thou hast a heart<br>
           Through which the warm blood flows, I pray thee go!<br>
           Go ere the Queen come down and see thee here!<br>
           Begone!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
What seekest thou?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br>
I seek the ring;<br>
           The ring that Queen Iseult let fall last night.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
The ring is mine; I picked it up!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span> (angrily).<br>
Iseult<br>
           Desires the ring! Str. Jester. I will not give it up!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br> The Queen will have thee
hung unless thou give<br>
           The ring to her. She wants the ring!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
                                  Iseult<br>
           Received the ring; she cast my gift away,<br>
           As she threw me away. I'll keep it now.<br>
           But if she wishes it so earnestly<br>
           Let her then come and beg the ring of me.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span>. <br> Audacious knave! How
vauntest thou thyself!<br>
           Give me the ring, and then begone, thou fool,<br>
           Ere Mark awake!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
                 To Queen Iseult herself<br>
           I'll give the ring, and to none else. She shall<br>
           Not let me die in misery as she<br>
           Desires God may help her in her grief!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span> (going up the stairs).<br>
           Thou fool, may God's damnation strike thee dead,<br>
           Thou and Lord Tristram for the night that's passed!<br>
           I'll bring thy words into the Queen that she<br>
           May have thee slain in secret by Gwain!</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE II</h2>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Brangaene</span> disappears above; the Strange
Jester cowers motionless, his head buried in his hands. After a moment <span class="sc">
Iseult</span>, in a white night robe, comes down the stairs with <span class="sc">
Brangaene</span>. She steps close in front of the Jester, who does not move. <span class="sc">
Brangaene</span> remains on the lowest step, leaning against the post of the
bannister.</p>
<br>
<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Thou gruesome fool, art
thou some bird of prey.<br>
           Some wolf that comes to feed upon my soul?<br>
           Wilt thou not go? Why liest thou in wait<br>
           For me here in the dawning light like some<br>
           Wild beast that waits its quarry?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span> (looking up heavily).<br>
Queen Iseult!<br>
           Oh dearest, fairest, sweetest one!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
How dar'st<br>
           Thou call me by such names! My boiling blood<br>
           Turns cold and shudders! Go!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span> (groaning softly).<br>
Where, lady, can<br>
           I find a sea whose endless depths are deep<br>
           Enough to drown my bitter misery?<br>
           Where? Tell me where, and I will go.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Go where<br>
           Thou wilt, so it be far away&#8212;so far<br>
           That the whole world shall sever thee and me,<br>
           And shall divide me from thy woe! My soul<br>
           Bleeds like an unheal'd wound when thou art near.<br>
           As though thou wert its murderer, and lo,<br>
           'Twill bleed to death from thy propinquity,<br>
           Thou fool! Hence, go, but give me first the ring<br>
           Thou stol'st last night and which in wanton jest<br>
           Thou torest from the hand of yon dead Knight.<br>
           It is Lord Tristram's ring.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
                       Ay, Queen Iseult,<br>
           The ring is his&#8212;above all other things<br>
           He values it!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                  Give me
the ring, else shalt<br>
           Thou die! I'll have thee slain, I swear, as sure<br>
           As I have suffered all this night such pangs<br>
           As suffered Mary at the cross of Christ.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span> (standing up).<br>
           The ring is mine! I gave it yonder man<br>
           To cherish like his life.&#8212;He's died for thee<br>
           And me;&#8212;I gave him too my soul to guard<br>
           That by this ring he might compel and bring<br>
           Thee to me in the wood tonight. Oh, 'twas<br>
           An evil hour for us both, Iseult,<br>
           That Lord Denovalin rode through the wood<br>
           Today. Now, answer me, Iseult, wilt thou<br>
           Still keep the oath thou sware to Tristram once?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (fixedly).<br>
           I'll break no oath that I have sworn, for God<br>
           Has sanctioned all my vows.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
                       Then call I thee,<br>
           Iseult the Goldenhaired, in Tristram's name,<br>
           And by this ring. [He hands her the ring.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>                Knowst thou
that oath as well.<br>
           Thou ghost!</p>
                       <p class="center">(Solemnly.)</p>
                 <p class="hang4">Oh God, here in this hand, grown pale<br>
           		And hot from resting on my heart all night,<br>
           		I hold the ring of gold and emerald stone<br>
           		By which I sware to Tristram to obey<br>
           		His will, and come to him when one should call<br>
           		Upon me by this ring and in his name!<br>
           		Lo, thou hast called upon me; I obey!<br>
           		What wishest thou of me, thou evil ghost<br>
           		With hollow sunken eyes? What wouldst thou have.<br>
           		Thou spectre of the twilight gloom?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
                                  I call<br>
           On thee, Iseult, my love, in my distress!<br>
           Oh know me now, who was thy lover once!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Thou suck'st my blood!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
           Thy blood was mine! Thy blood<br>
           Was once mine own! It was a crimson trust<br>
           reposing in my knightly hands to keep<br>
           Irrevocably until Death. And where<br>
           Thou goest there go I; and where thou stayst<br>
           There stay I too. So spoke thy blood&#8212;I come<br>
           To claim but what is mine.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (in great passion).<br>
What have I done<br>
           To thee that thou recountest my past life<br>
           As 'twere a mocking song? Who art thou, fool?<br>
           Who art thou? Speak? I'm knocking at thy soul<br>
           As knocks a dead man's soul outside the gates<br>
           Of Paradise! Who art thou, fool? Art thou<br>
           Magician? Art thou ghost? Art thou some soul<br>
           Forever wandering for some evil deed?<br>
           Art thou some faithless lover barred from Heav'n<br>
           And Hell eternally, whose punishment<br>
           It is to wander restless through the world<br>
           Forever begging love from women's hearts?<br>
           Did God permit that thou shouldst know what none,<br>
           Save only Tristram and myself have known?<br>
           That thou shouldst taste of bitter torment still<br>
           By thinking thou art Tristram and shouldst thus<br>
           Make greater expiation for thy sins?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
I am a faithless lover who has loved<br>
           Most faithfully, Iseult, belovèd one!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Why criest thou my name
unceasingly,<br>
           As scream enhungered owls, thou pallid fool?<br>
           Why starest thou at me with eyes that tears<br>
           And pain have rendered pitiless? I know<br>
           Naught of thy grief and am no leech to cure<br>
           Thy fool's disease!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (in growing agitation).<br>
Shall I shave off<br>
           My hair as thou hast done? Shall I too wear<br>
           A jester's parti-colored garb? Shall I<br>
           Go through the land, and howling in the streets<br>
           Bawl out Lord Tristram's name to make the throng<br>
           Of greasy knaves laugh? Speak? Is this the cure<br>
           Thou needest for thy grief? Does Tristram mock<br>
           Me through thy ribald wit? Does he revenge<br>
           Himself upon me thus because I loved<br>
           Him long before he saw Iseult, the Fair<br>
           Whitehanded Queen, and gave my soul and blood<br>
           To him? In scornful and in bitter words<br>
           Has he revealed our secret love to thee?<br>
           Has he betrayed me to his wife? Art thou<br>
           In league with her? Has her black spirit sent<br>

           Which once I knew, but which is dead?<br>
            Confess!<br>
           And! I will load thee down with precious gifts,<br>
           And daily pray for thee! I'll line thy way<br>

<p class="hang4">           Release my soul, thou fool, before I turn<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (remains a moment in his arms

             away shuddering).<br>
           When Tristram called, the Heavens echoed back<br>
           A golden peal, as echoes through the land<br>
           The music of a golden bell; the world rejoiced<br>
           And from its depths sprang up sweet sounds of joy.<br>
           And with them danced my heart exultingly!<br>
           When Tristram stood beside me, all the air<br>
           Was wont to quiver with a secret bliss<br>
           That made the beasts move 'round uneasily.<br>
           The birds sang in the dead of night and so<br>
           Betrayed us! Say, who broke the bond that knit<br>
           Our kindred souls in one?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
                     Lord Tristram broke<br>
           The bond and, faithless, took another wife!<br>
           Oh see, Iseult, how great the wrong he did<br>
           Us both!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (looking at him fixedly).<br>
                       I hear a raven's croak; I feel<br>

           Thou standest burning by my side, thou fool!<br>
           Thou pallid ghost!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>

           Of our great happiness&#8212;just thou and I,<br>
           Alone in blissful loneliness! And thou<br>
           Hast often listened to this voice when it.<br>
           In the deep forest, called the nightingales,<br>
           Alluring them to sing above thy head,<br>
           And like them whispered in thine ears<br>
           Soft words that made a wave of passion flow,<br>
           Sweet and voluptuous, through thy burning veins!<br>
           Iseult, shall I repeat those words? Wilt thou<br>
           Again go wandering through the world<br>
           With singing blood that makes our hearts beat high<br>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Lord Tristram's steps<br>

           From thy good steed and placed thee on mine own,<br>
           And held thee close embraced, while thou didst cling<br>
           To me like some fond child.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
And Tristram, bold<br>
           In the intoxication of his love,<br>
           Let go the reins, and gave his horse the spurs,<br>
           Till, like an arrow in full flight, it clove<br>
           The golden air and bore us heavenward!<br>
           How often have I dreamed of that wild ride.<br>
           And now with Isot of the Fair White Hands<br>
           He rides, as formerly with me&#8212;!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span>. <br>
                               And shall<br>
           I sing to thee, Iseult the Goldenhaired,<br>
           The lay of that White-handed wife who sits<br>
           And grieves by day and night? It is the sad<br>
           And sombre song of my great guilt. Her eyes<br>
           Are red from weeping&#8212;!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Ay, and mine are red<br>
           From weeping too! Fool, Fool, why mock'st thou me?<br>
           But since thou knowst so much of Tristram, tell<br>
           Me this; why did Lord Tristram marry her&#8212;,<br>
           This Isot of the Fair White Hands?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span> (slowly and painfully).<br>
There plays<br>
           About her mouth a silver smile; this smile<br>
           Enchanted him one lonely night. But, when,<br>
           At cold gray dawn, he heard her called Iseult<br>
           He nigh went mad with sorrow and with joy<br>
           From thinking of the real Iseult&#8212;of her,<br>
           The Goldenhaired&#8212;the beautiful, about<br>
           Whose mouth there plays a golden smile. Then, sick<br>
           At heart, and weary of this life, he wished<br>
           To die, until his sorrow drove him here,<br>
           To Cornwall, once again to see his love<br>
           Before he died and, face to face stand once<br>
           Again with her!&#8212;The rest thou knowest well.</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span> (angrily).<br>
           Ay, fool, I know the rest, and I know too<br>
           That for these black and loathsome lies of thine<br>
           There's one reward!&#8212;And that is death! I'll put<br>
           An end to my great suffering! If thou<br>
           Art Tristram thou shalt live, and, in mine arms,<br>
           That yearn for Tristram, thou shalt find a hot<br>
           And passionate forgetfulness of cool<br>
           And silver smiles thou fledest from! If thou<br>
           Hast lied no longer shalt thou dream at night<br>
           Of golden and of silver smiles!</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>
Obey me, girl!<br>
           Now listen, spectre, to my words. There lives<br>
           Within these walls a hound who has become<br>
           A wild and raging beast from his great love<br>
           For Tristram, once his master. Fool, this dog<br>
           Is full as savage as a fierce white wolf<br>
           That lusts for human flesh; his food is thrust<br>
           Into his cage on sticks. Since Tristram left,<br>
           The beast has slain three keepers. Fool, what think'st<br>
           Thou of this hound? Would he attack and tear<br>
           Lord Tristram like a wolf should Tristram chance<br>
           To step within his cage?</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Str. Jester</span> (rising, tall, determined,

           Oh Queen Iseult&#8212;! Old Husdent ever was<br>
           My faithful hound&#8212;. Let me go to him now.</p>

           Give me the key!</p>

           With Husdent leapt the wall and they are<br>
            gone! [She hastens to the window.]</p>

<p class="hang3"><span class="sc">Iseult</span>. <br>    Has he then slain the
